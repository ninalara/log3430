volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and\noctober 19 th were 9 dths and 44 dths respectively . those volumes were\npulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in\nplace . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .\nalso we just found out on tuesday that the oba did not go into effect until\ndecember 1 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in\neffect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact i thought that hpl had\nmade a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba do you\nremember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided\nthat the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even\ninformed us of this change i stumbled upon it when researching a november\nissue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this \ni received another email which i will copy below asking me to go in for the\nmonth of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match\nwhat hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long\nand matching to their numbers and we were clean for the deadline at the end\nof the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of\noctober and some of hpl s numbers were very different from tetco s \nincluding the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email\nback showing her tetco s numbers and i haven t received a response . i will\ncopy that email below as well just to catch you up on what s been going on .\njackie young\n12

service\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company inc . )\nnew york - ( dow jones ) - it s been a brutal year in the risk arbitrage business and that has many arbitrageurs also known as takeover traders steering clear of bets on dynergy inc . s ( dyn ) possible takeover of enron corp . ( ene ) .\nsome of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies .\nmore worrisome however is the possibility that enron - already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings - may have even deeper woes to report .\n unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world i don t see how a buyer could get comfortable . said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund .\nwhat worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change or mac clauses providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .\n as an investor it s hard for me to own something when i don t know what it is said the arbitrageur of enron . i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate but that s not enough for me . \nanother arbitrageur added if it gets announced it s a deal with a lot of issues starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud . \naccording to the wall street journal dynergy will swap nearly 0 . 27 of a share of its stock for each share of enron . also under the deal chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) which owns 26 % of dynergy will make an immediate cash injection of $ 1 . 5 billion into the deal and then add another billion on closing .\nshares of dynergy jumped more than 10 % in heavy trading bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal . its shares traded recently at $ 39 . 61 up $ 3 . 06 a share .\nan acquirer s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short while going long the target . in this case however arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy .\nenron meanwhile traded about 4 % higher recently swapping hands at $ 8 . 77 a share in heavy volume . the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody s . the firm downgraded enron s rating a notch to just above speculative not as bad as the junk rating some had feared .\ncopyright ?

( ene ) .\nsome of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies .\nmore worrisome however is the possibility that enron - already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings - may have even deeper woes to report .\n unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world i don t see how a buyer could get comfortable . said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund .\nwhat worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change or mac clauses providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .\n as an investor it s hard for me to own something when i don t know what it is said the arbitrageur of enron . i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate but that s not enough for me . \nanother arbitrageur added if it gets announced it s a deal with a lot of issues starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud . \naccording to the wall street journal dynergy will swap nearly 0 . 27 of a share of its stock for each share of enron . also under the deal chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) which owns 26 % of dynergy will make an immediate cash injection of $ 1 . 5 billion into the deal and then add another billion on closing .\nshares of dynergy jumped more than 10 % in heavy trading bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal . its shares traded recently at $ 39 . 61 up $ 3 . 06 a share .\nan acquirer s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short while going long the target . in this case however arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy .\nenron meanwhile traded about 4 % higher recently swapping hands at $ 8 . 77 a share in heavy volume . the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody s . the firm downgraded enron s rating a notch to just above speculative not as bad as the junk rating some had feared .\ncopyright ?

john\nsubject : fw : re - start integration planning\nalthough yesterday s meeting was excellent we do need to get a lot more detailed on the re - start plans . i would like everyone to have completed their re - start plans by the end of next week for mid back office . i realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with .\nas you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing .\nlet me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a jan 20 restart .\nthanks\nlouise\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : kitchen louise\nsent : thursday december 27 2001 4 : 58 pm\nto :

david oxley\n+ cash management tom myers\n+ credit debbie brackett\nthe rest will be completed shortly .\nwe now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus . john and i would like to receive the plans re - start integration plans by january 7 th 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups . the focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible . i have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but i thought it might help . please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually .\ncustomer side\n+ customers phase 1 - first week ( eg top 10 )\nphase 2 - first month ( eg top 50 )\nphase 3 - first quarter ( eg top 100 )\n+ action plan
