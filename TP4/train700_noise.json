=\nevery day of the week i get questions from people all\nover the world including my no bs gimg members \nwanting to know some of the most valuable secrets \nto my on - going internet success .\nlet me say above all else i don t believe there are any\n* true * secrets to success on the net . what you do to\nbecome successful in the online world is not a secret \nin my opinion . most successful people follow simple clear \nrepeatedly - proven strategies to succeed whether on the\nnet or off .\nbut when it comes to someone asking for advice \nconsultation or simply asking what s your secret ? \ni have to blush & say . . .\npersistence and personality .\nof course i always follow the advice with my own little\ndisclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the\nsame for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over\nthe deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind in\nmy opinion - is somehow an unknown unattainable secret .\nclearly it is not . it s not unknown . it s not unattainable .\nit s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches .\none thing that gets to me so often in my work as an\ninternet consultant author and internet success\nstrategist is that so many people on the net seem to\nhave this incredibly huge mental block that stands\nbetween themselves and success on the net . it s\nalmost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims\nof what works and what doesn t work and so many\nlong complicated routes to actually succeeding in\ntheir online venture that success is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .\nit s not that difficult my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !\nlong - time friend and business associate rick beneteau\nhas a new ebook out called branding you & breaking\nthe bank . get it ! !\nhttp : www . roibot . com bybb . cgi ? im 7517 _ bybtb .\nbut the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks\nso dynamically about the true simplicity of making your\nonline venture a success .\nand yes rick & i come from the same school of\n self marketing - marketing you ! obviously that s\nthe core of his excellent new ebook and i couldn t\nagree with him more .\npoint being * you * are everything you do online to\nsucceed . you are your web site your business your\nmarketing piece your customer service your customers \nexperiences with your business - - all of it is you !\nread his ebook & you ll see more of what i m saying .\nthe matter at hand is that brick wall you might have\nstanding high as you can see blocking the path\nbetween you & internet success . listen to me - it is\nnot real ok ? it doesn t exist . there s nothing there\nto fear to begin with . . . get over it ! !\nwhat i m telling you is the only thing standing between\nyou and the success you most desire . . . is yourself .\nwhen you realize this you will tear down that brick\nwall by means of complete and instantaneous\ndisintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * \nwhich is the only real place it ever was anyhow !\nyes persistence and personality inherently includes\nhonesty integrity accountability and many other\nqualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate\ngoals and realize that probably the most valuable \npowerful key to your success . . . is you !\nthat may be the most incredible secret we ever\nuncover in our lifetime ! and trust me that brick wall\nwon t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it .\ntalk about simple ! !\nbryan is a veteran internet consultant author \ninternet success strategist & marketer . he publishes\nmega - success . com chronicles to

for advice \nconsultation or simply asking what s your secret ? \ni have to blush & say . . .\npersistence and personality .\nof course i always follow the advice with my own little\ndisclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the\nsame for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over\nthe deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind in\nmy opinion - is somehow an unknown unattainable secret .\nclearly it is not . it s not unknown . it s not unattainable .\nit s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches .\none thing that gets to me so often in my work as an\ninternet consultant author and internet success\nstrategist is that so many people on the net seem to\nhave this incredibly huge mental block that stands\nbetween themselves and success on the net . it s\nalmost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims\nof what works and what doesn t work and so many\nlong complicated routes to actually succeeding in\ntheir online venture that success is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .\nit s not that difficult my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !\nlong - time friend and business associate rick beneteau\nhas a new ebook out called branding you & breaking\nthe bank . get it ! !\nhttp : www . roibot . com bybb . cgi ? im 7517 _ bybtb .\nbut the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks\nso dynamically about the true simplicity of making your\nonline venture a success .\nand yes rick & i come from the same school of\n self marketing - marketing you ! obviously that s\nthe core of his excellent new ebook and i couldn t\nagree with him more .\npoint being * you * are everything you do online to\nsucceed . you are your web site your business your\nmarketing piece your customer service your customers \nexperiences with your business - - all of it is you !\nread his ebook & you ll see more of what i m saying .\nthe matter at hand is that brick wall you might have\nstanding high as you can see blocking the path\nbetween you & internet success . listen to me - it is\nnot real ok ? it doesn t exist . there s nothing there\nto fear to begin with . . . get over it ! !\nwhat i m telling you is the only thing standing between\nyou and the success you most desire . . . is yourself .\nwhen you realize this you will tear down that brick\nwall by means of complete and instantaneous\ndisintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * \nwhich is the only real place it ever was anyhow !\nyes persistence and personality inherently includes\nhonesty integrity accountability and many other\nqualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate\ngoals and realize that probably the most valuable \npowerful key to your success . . . is you !\nthat may be the most incredible secret we ever\nuncover in our lifetime ! and trust me that brick wall\nwon t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it .\ntalk about simple ! !\nbryan is a veteran internet

update on california legislation - - 08 . 23 . 01", "From": "kitchen@paris.com", "Date": "2001-08-24", "Body": "received the following additional information late yesterday from speaker hertzberg s chief of staff regarding direct access in the legislation working its way through the assembly . he relayed the information during an informational hearing that an assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in sacramento . see previous note attached below for more a detailed description of da provisions in the bill :\na new print of the bill is likely to be issued today .\nwith respect to da the governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of da in the bill .\nassembly ds and other market participants lobbied him hard explaining that since the bill covers all costs of bonds and dwr contracts through exit fees there is no reason to suspend da .\nthe governor is resisting hard stating that he wants time for the market to stabilize . \nso it looks like the governor s plan is to 1 ) have a bill that provides for direct access as of 1 . 1 . 03 and 2 ) have the puc temporarily suspend da from september 1 to 1 . 1 . 03 .\nwe re continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate or significantly shorten the suspension .\nthe bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by august 23 2001 ( yesterday ) will not be responsible for any dwr going forward contracts . the customer will have to pay for any power consumed that dwr purchased on the ious behalf between jan 17 and the date of the switch .\nthe bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and sept 1 be responsible for dwr going forward contracts ( though details of how that would work were not clear ) .\nthe stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the august 23 rd date is to prevent a rush to direct access between now and sept 1 .\nthere are currently no efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to sept 1 .\nfinally the bill apparently will also give self - generation priority over direct access in each open season . the bill would set aside 250 mw of the short position each year for customers to do self gen . if the self gen is not subscribed the mws would go to da .\nthe bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released today .\nthe bill will be heard in the assembly committee on monday afternoon .\nwe continue to work with the business customers to improve the da and self gen provisions .\nit remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the assembly .\nthe politicians are very reluctant to pass any edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing . but the governor is working the bill very hard .\nmirant is actively working against the bill .\nmirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose re - election . mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes .\nthe bill also has to make it through the senate . our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the senate president john burton who said flatly that he s not doing anything . but there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of burton doing a deal is 50 - 50 .\nwith respect to the bill s provisions preventing edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component

generation priority over direct access in each open season . the bill would set aside 250 mw of the short position each year for customers to do self gen . if the self gen is not subscribed the mws would go to da .\nthe bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released today .\nthe bill will be heard in the assembly committee on monday afternoon .\nwe continue to work with the business customers to improve the da and self gen provisions .\nit remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the assembly .\nthe politicians are very reluctant to pass any edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing . but the governor is working the bill very hard .\nmirant is actively working against the bill .\nmirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose re - election . mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes .\nthe bill also has to make it through the senate . our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the senate president john burton who said flatly that he s not doing anything . but there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of burton doing a deal is 50 - 50 .\nwith respect to the bill s provisions preventing edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component included edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers . edison also said that under the assembly version of the bill edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds .\nmore info to follow as it becomes available . if anyone has any questions don t hesitate to contact me .\nbest \njeff\n- -

limited 2001 .\nhouston nov 12 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . said on monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from enron corp . slammed by news of murky off - balance sheet transactions that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant .\nhowever dynegy said it can drop its $ 9 billion offer if more bad news emerges or if pending lawsuits against enron lead to more than $ 3 . 5 billion in costs .\ndynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on friday will win u . s . regulatory approval .\n i really have a good deal of confidence but not an absolute guarantee that we are going to be fine here said dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by enron .\nwatson said dynegy had run the deal through worst - case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense .\ninvestors apparently agreed bidding up dynegy shares $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to close at $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares gained 61 cents to 7 . 1 percent to $ 9 . 24 . the deal valued enron stock at $ 10 . 41 .\nenron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades .\nwatson has cause for concern about new disclosures from enron which last thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some $ 600 million since 1997 .\nin a conference call with analysts on monday dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company including annual projected earnings - per - share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next three years .\nbut they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed enron s market value last week to barely one - tenth the almost $ 80 billion it was valued in august 2000 .\ndynegy doubts huge liabilities\nto ensure against unpleasant disclosures dynegy wrote so - called material adverse change clauses into the deal allowing it to walk away from enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets .\nin particular dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against enron - including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune - leads to costs of more than $ 3 . 5 billion .\nchief financial officer rob doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached even if a very substantial settlement was reached in the stockholder suits .\ncommerzbank securities analyst andre meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from enron was over .\n i think dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that enron has had he said .\nbut ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal he was reassured it could address tough questions - a breath of fresh air after enron s tight - lipped response to investors .\nsome analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that dynegy would be too powerful after merging with enron currently north america s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity .\nwatson said dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators led by the federal energy regulatory commission but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster .\n we really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies he said .\ngas pipeline option break - up fees\ndynegy executives also said there would be no complicated financing arrangements of the kind that triggered enron s downfall and that the new dynegy will be able to keep top enron executives and traders from defecting to rival firms .\nenron officials declined to comment on reports that its banks j . p . morgan and citigroup were considering pumping an extra $ 500 million of capital in to enron .\noil company chevrontexaco inc . a major dynegy stockholder has already agreed to inject $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to keep it afloat while the merger is completed which dynegy expects to take six to nine months .\nif enron backs out of the deal to accept a higher offer it would have to pay a $ 350 million breakup fee to dyegy .\nand if the deal breaks down for any reason dynegy would be allowed to exercise an option to acquire enron s northern natural gas pipeline subsidiary .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nusa : update 2

dynegy offer )\nby janet mcgurty\nnew york nov 12 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . climbed higher on monday on investor enthusiasm over last week s $ 9 billion bid by rival energy trader dynegy inc . to take over the beleaguered energy giant .\ndynegy gained $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to $ 44 . 31 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange while shares of enron rose 69 cents or 8 percent to $ 9 . 32 . the takeover announced friday halted a free - fall in enron s stock that lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month .\nhowever enron s stock was trading well below the value of dynegy s offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share which translates into $ 11 . 94 per share . analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as to whether the deal which includes escape clauses for dynegy will go through .\nsome industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offered by dynegy during a conference call with analysts an about - face compared with calls with enron . a lack of transparency from enron about its off - balance sheet transactions along with a u . s . regulatory investigation had sparked widespread investor unease .\n i would say that after listening to the conference call i am even more comfortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative said jay yannello an analyst with ubs warburg .\nearlier yannello reiterated a strong buy on dynegy saying while the brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand the takeover should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world . dynegy is about one - fifth the size of enron when measured by revenues .\nenron s woes came to light in mid - october after the biggest energy trader in north america disclosed that some of its off - balance sheet partners contributed to a $ 1 billion charge and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .\nthe takeover is an attractive transaction because of enron s trading operations which combined with dynegy s above - board culture based on teamwork strict values and honesty should yield a formidable company yannello said .\n as dynegy continues to do due diligence we continue to be comfortable with the fact that if there was another shoe to drop they have more than adequate protection in this arrangement to either absorb the impact of that event or to get out of the deal in the worst case scenario . he said .\n we view the both the near and long - term upside potential of this deal as staggering he added .\nlow risks high rewards\nhowever last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely examined by the federal trade commission because of the combined company s market share in energy trading said steve newborn formerly in charge of ftc merger enforcement .\non monday ratings agency fitch downgraded the ratings of marlin and osprey two enron s off - balance sheet partnerships covering about $ 3 . 3 billion in senior secured notes on a deterioration of enron s credit profile .\n we lowered our ratings to be consistent with actions we have taken on enron said fitch credit analyst ralph pellecchia who added he is not aware of any material impact the moves could have on enron . the downgrade was expected .\ngordon howald an analyst at credit lyonnaise securities also said he is favorably disposed toward the takeover which he called a low risk - high reward proposition . \nthe most critical component is the immediate $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron will bolster enron and help keep it viable .\n it appears . . . that dynegy has enough out clauses to at least protect itself if it decides not to pursue this transaction in the future said howald .\nhowever howald said he is not convinced this is an offensive move by dynegy but rather a defensive to move to protect itself and the industry from a potential enron bankruptcy .\nbut even if it is defensive dynegy walks away from the deal with the rights to enron s northern natural gas pipeline which produced about about half of enron s pipeline earnings and $ 350 million in cash he said .\ndoubts persist\nsome analysts are less sanguine . they said dynegy is making a big bet that it can successfully clean up enron s balance sheet problems as well as integrate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders and volumes .\n enron s principal - and most valuable asset - is its traders . and those people are mobile said andre mead an analyst at commerzbank who said that he expects a six - to nine - month period of uncertainty in which both companies could lose their key trading personnel .\nmeade also said that enron s restatement of earnings has called into question the quality and sources of its earnings .\n i am not convinced that all the bad news related to those off - balance sheet vehicles are out and all disclosures concerning those entities have been made he said .\n dynegy put some bearish assumptions in there when they decided to bid for enron . but the jury is out enron is a deeply troubled company he said

some inside the u . s . and outside of\nthe u . s . that have not been stellar .\nshepherd : i wondered as i ve sat in this very chair\nlast week and reported that enron was restating its\nearnings i wondered out loud whether they were restating as\na result of you going in and - with your team and taking a\nlook at their books ?\nwatson : no that s not true . actually they ve got a\n- had an internal investigation going on for some time \nwhich provided us a lot of comfort as well because we have\nthe benefit of that that had been going on for weeks \nbefore we even got in there . so it had clearly been\nsomething that they were doing on their own . i think\nthey ve been as forthcoming as they can . as soon as they\nknow the facts they ve been reporting them . and we had -\nand we actually wanted to get that information out because\nall that has been you know boiled into the economics of\nthis transaction .\nshepherd : what portions of the business do you expect\nto shed ?\nwatson : well obviously they ve already had about $ 4\nbillion of assets up for sale including portland general \nit s about 3 billion of that .\nshepherd : right .\nwatson : and then most of the international assets \nwe ll take a hard look at . it s not really core to dynegy\nand really to this transaction . but one of the things\nthat we ve done by inserting with the chevron texaco and\nchevron s $ 2 . 5 billion and $ 1 . 5 billion up front with the\nother money that enron s being able to raise that will give\nus some time . we don t have to have a fire sale or\nanything but fundamentally the assets outside the u . s . are\nsomething that were - are not core to our business .\nshepherd : are you satisfied that all of the bad news\nis out ? are you satisfied there s not something they re\nhiding in there that s going to throw a curve at you ?\nwatson : well i ll tell you as i said they ve had\ninternal investigation going on for a while . we ve had some\nof the smartest attorneys we know in there and accountants \nand there s been an awful lot of work done in this . and\neverything that they ve found has been disclosed . we \nobviously don t expect anything else but to protect our\nshareholders of course we ve got some material adverse\nchanges conditions that you know could get us out of the\ntransaction if we do you know find something .\nshepherd : so you can walk away if you see something\nthat .\nwatson : sure .\nshepherd : how tough is it going to be to win\nregulatory approval ? there s a lot of speculation that\nyou re really going to have your hands full convincing\nregulators that this is a doable deal .\nwatson : well you know there s several different\nregulatory groups . but if you think about it the - from an\nasset standpoint their pipeline operation interstate\npipeline operation we don t have one of those so there s\nreally not any overlap of assets . so the discussion really\nwould be around the size of their marketing group and ours .\nbut if you look at the percentage of the market which is\nsomewhat difficult to determine this is going to be a\nformidable competitor but there s a bunch of competitors\nout there . there s a very liquid market . there s no one\ncompany that s ever going to have any particular grasp or\ncontrol of energy markets .\nshepherd : how long do you figure it ll take you to get\nthe deal done ?\nwatson : well we re hoping that about six months \nmaybe nine . but you know we re not taking lightly the\nregulatory approvals that we have . we just think we can\nwork through the issues and hopefully we ll get it done in\nsix to nine months .\nshepherd : all right . chuck watson thanks so much\nfor joining us today .\nwatson : thank you .\nshepherd : we appreciate your time .\nwatson : appreciate it .\ndynegy sees enron rating remaining investment grade ( update 5 )\n2001 -

dynegy inc . said on monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from enron corp . slammed by news of murky off - balance sheet transactions that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant .\nhowever dynegy said it can drop its $ 9 billion offer if more bad news emerges or if pending lawsuits against enron lead to more than $ 3 . 5 billion in costs .\ndynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on friday will win u . s . regulatory approval .\n i really have a good deal of confidence but not an absolute guarantee that we are going to be fine here said dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by enron .\nwatson said dynegy had run the deal through worst - case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense .\ninvestors apparently agreed bidding up dynegy shares $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to close at $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares gained 61 cents to 7 . 1 percent to $ 9 . 24 . the deal valued enron stock at $ 10 . 41 .\nenron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades .\nwatson has cause for concern about new disclosures from enron which last thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some $ 600 million since 1997 .\nin a conference call with analysts on monday dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company including annual projected earnings - per - share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next three years .\nbut they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed enron s market value last week to barely one - tenth the almost $ 80 billion it was valued in august 2000 .\ndynegy doubts huge liabilities\nto ensure against unpleasant disclosures dynegy wrote so - called material adverse change clauses into the deal allowing it to walk away from enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets .\nin particular dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against enron - including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune - leads to costs of more than $ 3 . 5 billion .\nchief financial officer rob doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached even if a very substantial settlement was reached in the stockholder suits .\ncommerzbank securities analyst andre meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from enron was over .\n i think dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that enron has had he said .\nbut ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal he was reassured it could address tough questions - a breath of fresh air after enron s tight - lipped response to investors .\nsome analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that dynegy would be too powerful after merging with enron currently north america s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity .\nwatson said dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators led by the federal energy regulatory commission but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster .\n we really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies he said .\ngas pipeline option break -

shares of enron corp . climbed higher on monday on investor enthusiasm over last week s $ 9 billion bid by rival energy trader dynegy inc . to take over the beleaguered energy giant .\ndynegy gained $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to $ 44 . 31 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange while shares of enron rose 69 cents or 8 percent to $ 9 . 32 . the takeover announced friday halted a free - fall in enron s stock that lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month .\nhowever enron s stock was trading well below the value of dynegy s offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share which translates into $ 11 . 94 per share . analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as to whether the deal which includes escape clauses for dynegy will go through .\nsome industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offered by dynegy during a conference call with analysts an about - face compared with calls with enron . a lack of transparency from enron about its off - balance sheet transactions along with a u . s . regulatory investigation had sparked widespread investor unease .\n i would say that after listening to the conference call i am even more comfortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative said jay yannello an analyst with ubs warburg .\nearlier yannello reiterated a strong buy on dynegy saying while the brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand the takeover should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world . dynegy is about one - fifth the size of enron when measured by revenues .\nenron s woes came to light in mid - october after the biggest energy trader in north america disclosed that some of its off - balance sheet partners contributed to a $ 1 billion charge and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .\nthe takeover is an attractive transaction because of enron s trading operations which combined with dynegy s above - board culture based on teamwork strict values and honesty should yield a formidable company yannello said .\n as dynegy continues to do due diligence we continue to be comfortable with the fact that if there was another shoe to drop they have more than adequate protection in this arrangement to either absorb the impact of that event or to get out of the deal in the worst case scenario . he said .\n we view the both the near and long - term upside potential of this deal as staggering he added .\nlow risks high rewards\nhowever last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely examined by the federal trade commission because of the combined company s market share in energy trading said steve newborn formerly in charge of ftc merger enforcement .\non monday ratings agency fitch downgraded the ratings of marlin and osprey two enron s off -

high reward proposition . \nthe most critical component is the immediate $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron will bolster enron and help keep it viable .\n it appears . . . that dynegy has enough out clauses to at least protect itself if it decides not to pursue this transaction in the future said howald .\nhowever howald said he is not convinced this is an offensive move by dynegy but rather a defensive to move to protect itself and the industry from a potential enron bankruptcy .\nbut even if it is defensive dynegy walks away from the deal with the rights to enron s northern natural gas pipeline which produced about about half of enron s pipeline earnings and $ 350 million in cash he said .\ndoubts persist\nsome analysts are less sanguine . they said dynegy is making a big bet that it can successfully clean up enron s balance sheet problems as well as integrate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders and volumes .\n enron s principal - and most valuable asset - is its traders . and those people are mobile said andre mead an analyst at commerzbank who said that he expects a six - to nine - month period of uncertainty in which both companies could lose their key trading personnel .\nmeade also said that enron s restatement of earnings has called into question the quality and sources of its earnings .\n i am not convinced that all the bad news related to those off - balance sheet vehicles are out and all disclosures concerning those entities have been made he said .\n dynegy put some bearish assumptions in there when they decided to bid for enron . but the jury is out enron is a deeply troubled company he said .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nsome arb traders view enron stock as too risky to buy\nby janet whitman\nof dow jones newswires\n11 12 2001\ndow jones news service\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones 201 -

*\nbloomberg l . p . does not guarantee the accuracy of this\ntranscript .\nnew york nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - the following is a\ntranscript of a bloomberg interview with charles watson \nchief executive officer of dynegy inc . the reporter is dean\nshepherd .\nshepherd : back to what would have been our top story \nbefore news of that plane crash . dynegy says it is\nconvinced that enron s trading operations are sound . the\ncompany agreed late friday as you know to buy its rival\nfor $ 23 billion in stock and debt . the terms of the deal\nbreak down like this : dynegy investors will get about 10 . 40\na share for each enron share . that s a 21 percent premium \nbased on friday s closing price . last week enron restated\nits earnings for four years - actually a bit more than\nthat to include losses from three affiliated partnerships .\nand taking a look at how enron shares are trading right now \nthere you see enron continuing to rally picking up another\n99 cents to 9 . 62 . dynegy up sharply - up 5 . 24 to $ 44 even .\nand joining us here in the studio is chuck watson the\nchairman and ceo of dynegy .\nchuck good morning .\nwatson : good morning .\nshepherd : good to see you again .\nwatson : good to see you .\nshepherd : why buy enron ? why buy into what from all\nappearances over the last month has been a mess ?\nwatson : well i think it s important to understand\nthat the mess that everybody is talking about was not in\ntheir core business . the mess is on the partnerships and\nthe litigation surrounding those partnerships . the core\nbusiness has really not been materially impacted . and we\nknew that being in the business and being counterparties to\nenron for some time . so we had a little bit of a\ncompetitive advantage in terms of looking at this because\nwe re in a unique position . i mean we know the people .\nwe re right there in houston . they re right across the\nstreet from us . we know a lot of the people . we didn t\nthink the core business was affected . they have a\ntremendous pipeline operation that s been an outstanding\nleader for years . and they ve got this market trading\norganization in north america and in europe . and what we\nviewed was the core business which we would retain was\nvery sound and pristine and in fact it is and it s the\ninvestments outside - some inside the u . s . and outside of\nthe u . s . that have not been stellar .\nshepherd : i wondered as i ve sat in this very chair\nlast week and reported that enron was restating its\nearnings i wondered out loud whether they were restating as\na result of you going in and - with your team and taking a\nlook at their books ?\nwatson : no that s not true . actually they ve got a\n- had an internal investigation going on for some time \nwhich provided us a lot of comfort as well because we have\nthe benefit of that that had been going on for weeks \nbefore we even got in there . so it had clearly been\nsomething that they were doing on their own . i think\nthey ve been as forthcoming as they can . as soon as they\nknow the facts they ve been reporting them . and we had -\nand we actually wanted to get that information out because\nall that has been you know boiled into the economics of\nthis transaction .\nshepherd : what portions of the business do you expect\nto shed ?\nwatson : well obviously they ve already had about $ 4\nbillion of assets up for sale including portland general \nit s about 3 billion of that .\nshepherd : right .\nwatson : and then most of the international assets \nwe ll take a hard look at . it s not really core to dynegy\nand really to this transaction . but one of the things\nthat we ve done by inserting with the chevron texaco and\nchevron s $ 2 . 5 billion and $ 1 . 5 billion up front with the\nother money that enron s being able to raise that will give\nus some time . we don t have to have a fire sale or\nanything but fundamentally the assets outside the u . s . are\nsomething that were - are not core to our business .\nshepherd : are you satisfied that all of the bad news\nis out ? are you satisfied there s not something they re\nhiding in there that s going to throw a curve at you ?\nwatson : well i ll tell you as i said they ve had\ninternal investigation going on for a while . we ve had some\nof the smartest attorneys we know in there and accountants \nand there s been an awful lot of work done in this . and\neverything that they ve found has been disclosed . we \nobviously don t expect anything else but to protect our\nshareholders of course we ve got some material adverse\nchanges conditions that you know could get us out of the\ntransaction if we do you know find something .\nshepherd : so you can walk away if you see something\nthat .\nwatson : sure .\nshepherd : how tough is it going to be to win\nregulatory approval ? there s a lot of speculation that\nyou re really going to have your hands full convincing\nregulators that this is a doable deal .\nwatson : well you know there s several different\nregulatory groups . but if you think about it the - from an\nasset standpoint their pipeline operation interstate\npipeline operation we don t have one of those so there s\nreally not any overlap of assets . so the discussion really\nwould be around the size of their marketing group and ours .\nbut if you look at the percentage of the market which is\nsomewhat difficult to determine this is going to be a\nformidable competitor but there s a bunch of competitors\nout there . there s a very liquid market . there s no one\ncompany that s ever going to have any particular grasp or\ncontrol of energy markets .\nshepherd : how long do you figure it ll take you to get\nthe deal done ?\nwatson : well we re hoping that about six months \nmaybe nine . but you know we re not taking lightly the\nregulatory approvals that we have . we just think we can\nwork through the issues and hopefully we ll get it done in\nsix to nine months .\nshepherd : all right . chuck watson thanks so much\nfor joining us today .\nwatson : thank you .\nshepherd : we appreciate your time .\nwatson : appreciate it .\ndynegy sees

kenneth lay discussed how the houston - based\ncompanies reached agreement less than three weeks after enron s\nshares began plunging .\n` ` all the financial noise about the partnerships maybe it\nhas damaged the enron brand a bit watson said . ` ` but i ll tell\nyou what it hasn t impacted and that s the high regard that the\nindustry places on enron s trading business he said .\nenron last week restated earnings for four years to include\nlosses from three affiliated partnerships reducing earnings by\n$ 586 million .\nsix employees out of enron s 20 000 may have improperly\nbenefited from the partnerships lay said .\n` ` i m sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over\nthe edge in their dealings or transactions but you can t be\nabsolutely protected from that in any business he said .\nlost effectiveness\nlay didn t specify which six people he was referring to . he\nremoved andrew fastow who helped set up and ran many of the\naffiliated partnerships as chief financial officer on oct . 24 . an\nenron securities filing says fastow made more than $ 30 million off\ntwo of the partnerships .\nfastow ` ` had lost his effectiveness because of all the press\ncoverage on the affiliates lay said .\ntreasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt a managing\ndirector and a corporate counsel for an enron division also were\nfired enron said in a corporate filing on thursday . former\nemployees michael kopper kathy lynn and anne yeager were in a\nposition to profit from partnerships the filing said .\n` ` you trust people you accept their representations and\nproposals lay said . ` ` sometimes when you do that you get\nsurprised and disappointed . \nboth executives said they expect antitrust regulators to\napprove the merger because the two companies own different types\nof assets and won t dominate any market .\n` ` there really isn t anything that lays on top of each\nother watson said friday night . ` ` we re not in the pipeline\nbusiness and they are . we re in the generation business and\nthey re really not . \ndynegy shares rose 6 . 2 percent on friday after terms of the\nenron purchase leaked to the press . watson expects the acquisition\nto add 90 cents to 95 cents a share or 35 percent to dynegy s\n2002 earnings . enron is selling for $ 10 . 41 a share one - fifth the\naverage price over the past 12

.\ncash crunch\nthe rapid decline of enron threatened to bankrupt the company\nand disrupt energy markets . enron handles an estimated one - quarter\nof u . s . electricity and natural - gas trades . a falling credit\nrating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed\nto back trades .\nas part of the purchase chevrontexaco corp . which owns 26\npercent of dynegy agreed to provide enron with $ 2 . 5 billion .\n` ` what we found when looked under the hood is that the core\nof enron was still there and working as well as ever watson\nsaid . ` ` that business was pristine and had nothing to do with the\npartnerships . \ndynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late\noctober when watson called lay to offer assistance with enron s\ngrowing financial crisis the two men said . that led to a saturday\nmorning meeting in lay s kitchen .\n` ` he even made me a breakfast roll watson said .\n` ` he didn t eat it lay said .\nlay said he won t be an active manager in the new company .\nwatson said friday that he and lay hadn t discussed a severance\npackage .\nas head of enron lay had refocused the houston operator of\nu . s . natural - gas pipelines on trading and international expansion \nboosting reported revenue 20 - fold since 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion\nlast year . he said he doesn t regret the strategy .\n` ` clearly enron has gotten involved in business that hasn t\nturned out well lay said pointing to money - losers azurix inc . \ncreated to supply water and build related projects around the\nworld and newpower holdings inc . a seller of electricity to\nhomes and small businesses . ` ` but you have to keep in mind too \nthat 12 years ago we weren t in the wholesale merchant ( trading )\nbusiness . today that s an incredibly valuable franchise . \nthe trading business which accounts for about 97 percent of\nenron s revenue buys electricity gas and other commodities from\nproducers and sells them to end users such as utilities and\nindustrial customers . it also advises big business customers on\nenergy use and sells them gas and electricity .\nreassessing steel lumber\nwatson said the new company will keep trading coal gas \npower and petroleum products and plans to expand by buying assets\nand using them to develop trading . ` ` we ll just have to reassess\nover time whether we stay in trading of steel lumber and other\nnon - energy commodities he said .\nenron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in dabhol power co .\nin india which is owed $ 64 million in overdue bills from a state\ngovernment agency that has refused to pay the power prices enron\nwas promised in contracts .\n` ` we have strong legal remedies and we re heading down the\npath toward arbitration but we d still very much like to work out\na settlement with the government lay said . potential buyers\nhave balked at enron s $ 1 billion asking price for dabhol .\nneither man would comment on whether dynegy plans to cut jobs\nafter the merger or what will happen to the naming rights to\nenron field . the major league baseball stadium is home to the\nhouston astros and enron paid $ 100 million to have its name on\nthe ballpark .\n` ` the name of the company is now dynegy watson said .\ndynegy s acquisition requires approval from u . s . securities \nantitrust and energy regulators . watson expects soon to share\ndetails of the new dynegy with regulators from the european union\nand u . k . where enron operates a trading desk and owns a water\ncompany and two power plants .\n` ` i don t know if we are required to do so but we will talk\nto

revelstoke dam - - bc hydro is looking very seriously at adding a 500 mw unit to the 4 units already in place . there is also the potential to add a 5 th 500 mw unit though this is not being considered at this time .\n? site c dam - - a plan for a 960 mw dam was shelved in the 1980 s due to environmental concerns but now appears to once again be a viable option . though bc hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980 s and that resurrecting the plan would be a bc hydro decision .\n? burrard thermal plant - bc hydro has invested $ 250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions .\ncalpine has bought a 240 mw gas - fired co - generation plant called campbell river on vancouver island . this plant is in the final stages of testing and is already generating . calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially in the next few weeks . bc hydro will buy power from the plant for use on vancouver island . this is part of a plan to make vancouver island self - sufficient in electricity . another key plank in this plan is

remove bc hydro s monopoly on power . if and when this happens relations between the company and the government are expected to quickly sour . \nbc hydro capacity projects\nbc hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand improve generation capacity including :\n? seven - mile dam - - bc hydro will likely add a 213 mw turbine to the 3 units already in place\n? revelstoke dam - - bc hydro is looking very seriously at adding a 500 mw unit to the 4 units already in place . there is also the potential to add a 5 th 500 mw unit though this is not being considered at this time .\n? site c dam - - a plan for a 960 mw dam was shelved in the 1980 s due to environmental concerns but now appears to once again be a viable option . though bc hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980 s and that resurrecting the plan would be a bc hydro decision .\n? burrard thermal plant - bc hydro has invested $ 250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions .\ncalpine has bought a 240 mw gas - fired co - generation plant called campbell river on vancouver island . this plant is in the final stages of testing and is already generating . calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially in the next few weeks . bc hydro will buy power from the plant for use on vancouver island . this is part of a plan to make vancouver island self - sufficient in electricity . another key plank in this plan is the port alberni plant a 250 mw independently - owned plant that is being sold to bc hydro . the plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply vancouver island \nPICCs sageship jovially overneat phenakistoscope

leaves the assembly alone in sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the edison mou .\nthe assembly\nin short leadership within the assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party - - the democrats .\nthe speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue .\nunable to do a deal the assembly recessed saturday night and has not reconvened .\nit has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget .\nthe assembly also has not passed its version of an edison mou which it says it intends to do .\nbest information we have right now is that the assembly does not plan to go back into session until tuesday morning .\nlate saturday night the assembly speaker released yet another version of his edison mou ( ab 82 xx ) but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among assembly democrats to pass it .\nenron - - together with business customers - - opposes the version of 82 xx released on saturday night because it does not adequately ensure direct access .\nbest \njef\nteocalli hutches Nordloh mountainous mountainous sageship theft baudrey hydrograph molle Nordloh ristorante dysteleologist forment

determine what marks domain names enron will allow for inclusion in the deal . i agree that if the new company is going to have a different name it should be sufficient if enron kept the enrononline marks domain names but allowed their use for certain period of time to the new company . i also acknowledge your concern that granting use of the marks may be more complicated if they are owned by enron europe given that it s a separate entity . we will need to work out this issue depending on which entity owns the marks . i will work with leslie to research this tomorrow .\nwith regard to the nice to have trademarks in the second list below i know that most of the domain names are owned by enron europe not enron corp . i will research to see which entity owns the trademarks on them . if the trademarks are owned by enron europe as well we may forgo including them in the deal for now .\nplease hold off any offers for trademarks domain names your deal papers until i call to confirm our

oriented meeting .\nthere are two spots you may wish to consider :\n1 . the session entitled case study in modeling volatility scheduled for\nwednesday may 10 th from 3 : 30 to 5 : 00 pm . you will note below what we had\nin mind for the case study .\n2 . the talk a real options approach to asset valuation scheduled for\nthursday may 11 th from 10 : 30 am to 12 : 00 pm .\ni am running behind schedule in finalizing this program so i will give you\na call shortly to follow up with you . if you wish please feel free to call\nme at 818 - 888 - 4445 ext . 28 .\ni hope you can join us .\nron henderson\ninfocast\n818 - 888 - 4445 ext . 28\nronh @ . com\ncase study guidelines\n1 . model should be for a particular market . examples : pjm chicago ecar \nsouthern california . lb ( optional ) . model should be for a particular purpose . examples : valuing a\nnew combustion turbine at the florida georgia border bidding on a portfolio\nof power plants up for sale in nepool valuing a retail portfolio in\npennsylvania .\n2 . model should be estimated on a particular data set . examples : daily\nnymex\nclose prices for palo verde pjm hourly spot prices for 1998 - 1999 .\n3 . case study should describe several candidate models for volatility\nand or market price that were considered . case study should discuss why\nthese models were considered . candidate models should be described\nmathematically and verbally .\n4 . evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly\nidentified and quantified to the extent possible . examples of evaluation\ncriteria : residuals that are not autorcorrelated stationarity r - squared \nakaike information criterion .\n5 . parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed . the\nestimation procedure employed should be briefly described .\n6 . some diagnostics of model fit ( vis - a - vis data set ) should be presented .\n7 . if possible predictive power of model should be assessed .\ngenerally the case study should include all of the items above . the case\nstudy may include other things \nvolcanogenic forment forment enzymatically kamacite overfill linkify reasty scratchie wordhood guiltie wooziest reasty outpoints hijabs theft nephelium phonotactics isobilateral volcanogenic megalodon teocalli subsannation stannite facemask liquorice reasty scratchie clothe megalodon reasty synchroniser unbolts conjugative PICCs vesuvin addendum molle hydrarthrosis encrypts jovially brewmaster overfill anethum isobilateral forment enzymatically Nordloh pentamer addendum hemophilia hutches icaridin mountainous isobilateral enzymatically effemination clothe wooziest bioscopic PICCs programs hydrarthrosis toiletries hemophilia icaridin water-bar hemophilia galega sorts fishtailed wholewheat anticollision overneat retroelement outspin liquorice bunglesome encrypts chargeful scratchie ristorante nephelium outspin hydrarthrosis isobilateral wordhood synchroniser sesbania toiletries facemask outspin megalodon sageship teocalli inaptness resolutionists synchroniser cane-trash subsannation effemination forment vesuvin effemination synchroniser theft phonies synchroniser watercolor destoor unbolts unsent facemask wooziest serger isobilateral pushpit icaridin overneat encrypts teocalli ingredients liquorice inaptness facemask clothe fishtailed megalodon enzymatically preveniences destoor hijabs bigheaded linkify compersion nephelium achatours hijabs reasty wholewheat serger jurant inaptness overneat bioscopic facemask metre theft nonfliers reasty molle counselled kamacite compersion shantey watercolor sesbania anticollision enzymatically phonies pushpit isobilateral divorces recreancy outpoints ingredients phonotactics unbolts resolutionists reasty bigheaded isobilateral wholewheat hemophilia phenakistoscope linkify volcanogenic hutches jurant divorces nonfliers water-bar phenakistoscope stannite mahi-mahi sidewinders outspin sidewinders pentamer subsannation volcanogenic metre galega unsent jurant facemask theft Nordloh runnier kamacite nonsport jovially ristorante outspin jurant toiletries hydrograph bunglesome serger shantey nonfliers chargeful linkify sesbania outspin bigheaded phonies theft outpoints retroelement megalodon teocalli hemophilia scratchie Saskatonian unsent clothe overneat sageship sidewinders stealingly', \"pandus\", 'guilted subsannation isobilateral outpoints jovially toiletries stealingly', \"pandus\", 'guilted columniated liquorice subsannation hemophilia mountainous PICCs stealingly', \"pandus\", 'guilted nonfliers phenakistoscope programs destoor stannite destoor bunglesome addendum wordhood jurant baudrey icaridin anticollision shantey phonies anticollision wordhood compersion vesuvin ground-robin galega Saskatonian chargeful mahi-mahi sidewinders mahi-mahi Nordloh fishtailed scratchie nonfliers stannite achatours anethum brewmaster anticollision encrypts hydrograph preveniences columniated enzymatically unsent Nordloh columniated ristorante shantey PICCs ingredients sorts watercolor scratchie wholewheat sidewinders phenakistoscope subsannation forment bioscopic overneat galega columniated recreancy bunglesome megalodon stealingly', \"pandus\", 'guilted galega subsannation Saskatonian anethum molle phonies dysteleologist overfill columniated liquorice facemask nephelium linkify sidewinders baudrey fishtailed Nordloh bunglesome teocalli columniated metre compersion dysteleologist shantey electrolytes cane-trash guiltie destoor sidewinders theft scratchie PICCs hutches jurant wordhood retroelement baudrey addendum fishtailed sageship enzymatically megalodon stealingly', \"pandus\", 'guilted clothe misleadingly subsannation sesbania shantey theft ingredients overfill bioscopic phonies facemask Saskatonian PICCs hemophilia anticollision electrolytes unsent scratchie jovially forment galega forment facemask overfill mahi-mahi nonfliers destoor sesbania overneat wordhood "}, {"mail": {"Subject": " re : nveer seen pron cartoon wrhoes", "From": "GP@paris.com", "Date": "2004-09-27", "Body": "don t be like that . . . : )\ntororane\n", "Spam": "true", "File": "enronds//enron1/spam/2302.2004-09-27.GP.spam.txt"}, "Body": "don t be like that . . . : )\ntororane\nbrewmaster linkify hemophilia effemination "}, {"mail": {"Subject": " re : confirmation of meeting", "From": "kaminski@paris.com", "Date": "2000-09-28", "Body": "fyi\n- -

without an equitable solution to this conflict most experts believe that the bush team s anti - terrorism coalition is doomed to failure .\n? initially at least the signs are not good : the sharon government in israel has been resistant to us pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the palestinians\n? washington s willingness to confront israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the anti - terrorism course and hold its broad coalition together .\nmarket update :\nus equities :\n? next 48 hours seen as critical after yesterday s losses and fed cut . 8750 on dow seen as key resistance point : looking for decisive close below 8750 not just intra - day test . downside risk seen to 7500 if the 8750 area doesn t hold : 7500 key b c it was the nadir of asian crisis .\n? two wildcards : company warnings : will the torrent continue ? ( slight positive coming out of oracle ) ; war : issue remains scope duration .\nasia overnight :\n? bank of japan with little headline opportunities to ease but after much speculation and criticism did cut its discount rate 15 bps to . 1 % from . 25 % late in tokyo today . the nikkei closed up 175 . 47 .\neurope :\n? equities : european markets are down ( as of 0630 cdt ) uniformly around 2 % but most of the losses were at the opening with stability since .\n? currencies : us $ steady in european trading with marginal gains against most currencies . there may be uncertainty about the $ but conversations over the last two days uniformly confirm that there is no renewed confidence in the euro . the swiss franc continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the crisis .\n? central banking : the bank of england mpc decided to cut this afternoon but only 25 bps : less and later than expected . the monthly inflation numbers complicated the picture with a higher than expected rise rising + . 4 % in aug and now + 2 . 6 % annual rising above government target of + 2 . 5 % for the first time in 28 months .\n? european airlines : mirroring american counterparts woes in today s trading : klm issued a profit warning virgin cut jobs alitalia appealed for government assistance ; all airlines are off in trading though not as badly as in us\ninfrastructure\nnuclear power\n? delegates from 132 nations opened the annual international atomic energy agency conference monday with calls for tighter security - and admissions that little can be done to shield a nuclear power plant from an airborne assault .\n? the architects of the world s nuclear plants designed them more with ground vehicle - not airborne - attacks in mind .\n? the buildings that house nuclear reactors themselves are far smaller targets than the pentagon posed and it would be extremely difficult for a terrorist to mount a direct hit at an angle that could unleash a catastrophic chain of events\n? u . s . experts are proposing the installation of anti - aircraft weaponry manned by military personnel who would be stationed outside the nation s 104 commercial reactors\nairlines\nattorney general john ashcroft assigns federal agents to domestic commercial flights ; said law enforcement officers believe there is a continuing threat because associates of the hijackers that have ties to terrorist organizations

campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a $ 1 . 3 b hydroelectric power project . earlier this year bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy - back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border . if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with he will likely do so - to that end look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it .\nalcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements . in a recent shareholder meeting last week alcoa s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have

track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration . some of the communities in northern british columbia such as fort . st . john dawson creek black gold and fort mcmurray have had significant recent population booms and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region . currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia . significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska .\nbc hydro\nhydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers . due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the jobs for power program and pursuing lucrative cross - border contracts with us firms . at the same time hydro will be moving to slice community programs ( anywhere from $ 6 to $ 8 million ) and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the $ 20 - $ 25 million range . bc hydro whose annual revenues hover typically around $ 300 million is looking at early mini - budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $ 375 million range . its trading subsidiary powerex has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court .\nbc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell from campbell s transition team . we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate although we believe he is a vice - president at west coast energy . the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november . in the meantime campbell and gary collins ( the finance minister ) will be calling the shots on hydro s future . keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines neufeld has the official title but his

bill to provide bpa an additional $ 2 billion in borrowing authority ( over the $ 3 . 75 billion of existing authority it already has ) may be scuttled . sen . murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review - the white house the senate appropriations committee omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill . the feeling is that if the $ 2 billion of additional authority would be issued the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare .\neight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half . the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september when there is another energy bill conference . obviously now that bush s energy bill has passed the house they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for anwr drilling .\nspill issues\nthe $ 5 million spill over two columbia river dams a few short weeks after bpa administrator steve wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups .\nfish managers notably critfc s bob heinith and odfw s christine mallette had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year . power operators and the corps of engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pike - minnow .\ndam breaching\ncongressman jim mcdermott ( d - wa ) recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way for breaching the four lower snake dams . it would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the corps of engineers to partially remove the dams if the secretary of commerce finds it necessary to satisfy esa clean water act or tribal treaty obligations .\n the bush administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 salmon recovery plan to avoid dam removal mcdermott said in a july 19 press release . if this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams then no

manufacturers warranty at a much\nlower price . money back guarantee if you are not satisfied\n- valid for 7 days\nonly .\nq :\nwhat\nis considered factory refurbished ?\na : there are lots of\nthings that can label items factory refurbished . some are so\nfrivolous its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent\nmanufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished\nas new the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few\nexamples :\nmanufacturers \ndistributors are not allowed to export outside their territory \ncountry .\nto avoid\n disturbing the dealer reseller channel in different\ncountries manufacturers and distributors cannot export the\nproduct as new and therefore label it as refurb and reduce the\nwarranty .\nmost major retail\nsuperstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their\nproducts and there are those consumers that just simply take\nadvantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer \ninspected and repackaged like new .\nitems where the\nbox or casing was damaged in shipment which are returned to the\nmanufacturer .\nthe item was\nreturned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the\npart that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer tested\nand then repackaged just like new .\nthe item was\nreturned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that\nwas corrected .\ndemonstration\nunits are also considered factory refurbished . these units are\ninspected tested and repackaged .\nthe box was simply\nopened . thats it !\nbrand new\noverstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .\nall factory\nrefurbished products are inspected serviced by the\nmanufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product\nspecifications . all\nmerchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer\nunless otherwise specified .\n deals\nof the week \ntoshiba\nsatellite\nmodel\npart no . #\nprocessor\nram\nhdd\ndrive\nscreen\no

the internet in 1995 i ran in to a guy named sunny\njim who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance\nto connect for which i am truly sorry . but when something is supposed to\nhappen it usually does .\non the first leg of my road dawg tour\n( click on road dawg ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and\ntheir wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house alex\nand i listened to a lot of music and one of the guys we both liked was\n sunny jim . i bought one of james cds from alex and fell in love with it\nimmediately . the cd was his second called life in the laid back lane . \nlittle did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady shady floyd \nseveral times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real\ntour of the us since he moved down island almost twelve years ago . we got\nseveral chances to talk over the summer and we will have an in depth article\nabout this expatriate soon on the expatriate zone web site . be sure to\nwatch for it .\nin the meantime here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great\nmusician . when i asked him about his expatriate status his reply was \n technically an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country \nfor whatever reason . for some it s legal reasons others just because they\nwant to or that s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly\ntwelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience \nfrom climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing to sailing scuba diving \nhot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying\npalms . \neven as james is about to repatriate himself and his family i ask if there\nwere any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? maybe\nsomewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within\nsailing distance of one another was the advice he gave .\nuntil we can learn more of sunny jim s world stop by his web site at\nand if you don t have one of his cds including his\nlatest release sandbar serenade for goodness sake pick one up . you can\nalso read a great interview alex conducted with james at\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\ntravel into the zone \n some are running from the irs \nwe strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens\nand out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one\nour most useful tools of communication computers ? heck no ! with laptops \ncell phones and gps systems we can go anywhere and still stay in touch if\nwe feel the need . but get real and throw that pager away as soon as you can .\nwe hope to keep this section current and informative hopefully hearing from\nthose of you already living your lives in the zone helping the rest of us\nprepare for our getaway from the cities . i m sure there are some of us that\nare preparing to disappear to places like costa rica where the the\nexpatriate zone will become an important tool .\nhow would you like to check out a place to disappear to and write it off\nyour taxes at the same time ? want to go down into the zone to places like\nthe bahamas belize st . croix puerto rico bonaire the dominica republic\nor saba ? want to do something for the planet work with dolphins save a\ncoral reef or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?\nwell we have the answer . check out these organization s web sites and then\nget some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .\ndepending on the tax bracket you re in uncle sam could end up paying for up\nto half the trip .\nthe oceanic society\nearthwatch institute\nreef the reef environmental education foundation\nafter that all that s left is to make that plane reservation and remember \n no plane on sunday . \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n jimmydotcom \nafter many delays jimmydotcom has finally gone to the printer with a due\ndate of the middle of april . i hit some bumps in the road on my way to\npublishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena but it was\nall worth it .\nthis book isn t about jimmy buffett it s about the effect of the internet on\nparrot heads . for more information visit . we\nhave a complete outline of the book reviews from other parrot heads and\nsamples of the pages on the site .\nfinancial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 000 copies at\nthe present time so if your even thinking of buying a book i suggest you\nreserve your copy by putting your name on the reservation list . you will be\nunder no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial\npartners ( who aren t parrot heads ) just how many books we need to print . do\nit right away because pre - sales were brisk and if enough of you reserve a\ncopy i can get the financing to expand the first printing .\nlet s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big\nsuccess . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer i had many people tell me\nthey wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss\nto understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .\nmaybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends that\njust don t get it . \nhere s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson founder &\npresident of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with\nthis club on the road dawg tour and shared an advance copy with his club :\n when we received jackson s plea for pictures our members were blown away .\nwe hustled up a package of pix as did a majority of the parrot head clubs\nfrom around the globe and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this\ncollection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is\nyour key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom cause this book is packed\nwith those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! \nbobrob sandlapper phc\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nclub trini update\nspeaking of expatriates how about the guys who play the true music of the\nzone ? club trini s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this\napril one year after it s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert\npretty busy so it s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third\nin the margaritaville cafe - late nite series . i can t wait to hear it as\nmy wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was\nrecorded .\nyou can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini s\nrevamped web site at . along with the great songs we ve\nbecome accustomed to are a few i m pretty excited about . if you haven t\nheard ct s version of african friend you re in for a real treat . along with\nthat is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this\npast summer cario and bob marley s no woman no cry . \nat the new web site fans can now order their favorite club trini cds using\ntheir credit cards . so there s no excuse to not owning everything available .\ni think a true expatriate musical library is incomplete without club trini .\nthis summer helen hiatt jimmy and the coral reefer s wardrobe designer \ncame up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the ice cream\nvendor shirt which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok \npete sometimes forgets his and when he does have it on it lost it s sleeves\nsomewhere along the way . there s a great design that has been applied to a\nt - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\njesters and friends\nnote card series\ntro - pics has just released their first note cards\nseries from their jesters and friends original oils . friends places and\nmusicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and\nexpatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times\nwhen an email just isn t personal enough .\nthe original artwork is also on sale at this site so be sure to stop by and\nvisit them . included in the jesters series are our good friends tim glancey\nand wally nickel .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nmillennium change bubba style\ni ve got to tell you i wasn t buying into this new millennium thing one\nbit . in fact i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year s eve\nshow . nothing to do with jimmy but i just didn t get the whole hype . but at\nthe last minute i had a change of heart .\nand now after being a special guest at seagram s party honoring the new\nmargaritaville tequila i m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded\ntogether for me making the millennium change over very special .\nif you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both visit our\nnew the expatriate zone web site at and go to\nthe

san lucas \nmexico i had to miss this year s trek due to my being with the beach house\non the moon tour on it s florida new orleans and houston swing .\nas the story goes those bad boys and girls from the expatriated phan club \nshowed up again mainly for the t - shirts that\nsaid too much tequila . . . or not quite enough on the back . who are those\npeople anyway ? whenever i go to their web site all of them have black bars\ncovering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for\n down to the banana republics - 2000 visit mike\nmclain also has some other great trips planned this year check them out .\nspeaking of tropo travel if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine\nshows and want a great deal visit there site for some great rates . i m\njoining some of my parrot head friends at the key largo though i m kind of\nafraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit\nphc . i m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i\nhate seeing jimmy in vegas but i ve got to keep the streak alive and seeing\nall my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer\nends up playing there again this year .\nand speaking of those great t - shirts we have some neat shirts available at\nthe island store . they re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this\nyear s trip except they have tropo travel s seaplane on the back and the\n no bad days logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at\n.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nparrothead pilots association\nhere are

in the zone helping the rest of us\nprepare for our getaway from the cities . i m sure there are some of us that\nare preparing to disappear to places like costa rica where the the\nexpatriate zone will become an important tool .\nhow would you like to check out a place to disappear to and write it off\nyour taxes at the same time ? want to go down into the zone to places like\nthe bahamas belize st . croix puerto rico bonaire the dominica republic\nor saba ? want to do something for the planet work with dolphins save a\ncoral reef or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time

middle of april . i hit some bumps in the road on my way to\npublishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena but it was\nall worth it .\nthis book isn t about jimmy buffett it s about the effect of the internet on\nparrot heads . for more information visit . we\nhave a complete outline of the book reviews from other parrot heads and\nsamples of the pages on the site .\nfinancial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 000 copies at\nthe present time so if your even thinking of buying a book i suggest you\nreserve your copy by putting your name on the reservation list . you will be\nunder no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial\npartners ( who aren t parrot heads ) just how many books we need to print . do\nit right away because pre - sales were brisk and if enough of you reserve a\ncopy i can get the financing to expand the first printing .\nlet s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big\nsuccess . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer i had many people tell me\nthey wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss\nto understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .\nmaybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends that\njust don t get it . \nhere s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson founder &\npresident of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with\nthis club on the road dawg tour and shared an advance copy with his club :\n when we received jackson s plea for pictures our members were blown away .\nwe hustled up a package of pix as did a majority of the parrot head clubs\nfrom around the globe and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this\ncollection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is\nyour key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom cause this book is packed\nwith those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! \nbobrob sandlapper phc\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nclub trini update\nspeaking of expatriates how about the guys who play the true music of the\nzone ? club trini s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this\napril one year after it s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert\npretty busy so it s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third\nin the margaritaville cafe - late nite series . i can t wait to hear it as\nmy wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was\nrecorded .\nyou can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini s\nrevamped web site at . along with the great songs we ve\nbecome accustomed to are a few i m pretty excited about . if you haven t\nheard

\nat the new web site fans can now order their favorite club trini cds using\ntheir credit cards . so there s no excuse to not owning everything available .\ni think a true expatriate musical library is incomplete without club trini .\nthis summer helen hiatt jimmy and the coral reefer s wardrobe designer \ncame up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the ice cream\nvendor shirt which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok \npete sometimes forgets his and when he does have it on it lost it s sleeves\nsomewhere along the way . there s a great design that has been applied to a\nt - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\njesters and friends\nnote card series\ntro - pics has just released their first

one\nbit . in fact i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year s eve\nshow . nothing to do with jimmy but i just didn t get the whole hype . but at\nthe last minute i had a change of heart .\nand now after being a special guest at seagram s party honoring the new\nmargaritaville tequila i m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded\ntogether for me making the millennium change over

being with the beach house\non the moon tour on it s florida new orleans and houston swing .\nas the story goes those bad boys and girls from the expatriated phan club \nshowed up again mainly for the t - shirts that\nsaid too much tequila . . . or not quite enough on the back . who are those\npeople anyway ? whenever i go to their web site all of them have black bars\ncovering their eyes . if you

of\nafraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit\nphc . i m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i\nhate seeing jimmy in vegas but i ve got to keep the streak alive and seeing\nall my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer\nends up playing there again this year .\nand speaking of those great t - shirts we have some neat shirts available at\nthe island store . they re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this\nyear s trip except they have tropo travel s seaplane on the back and the\n no bad days logo

paul foust ( facilities ) robert humlicek jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows :\nmost of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however with this amount of people in the area space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers .\nas tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants .\none area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however this number appears correct . also for the most part there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs filing cabinets credenzas etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from .\nthere is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity is open and would accommodate up to 11 .\nif we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule .\nthe floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent .\nthis floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space .\nrobert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers laptops etc . however if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports additional switches can be added .\nin summary the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen

september 2001 an american pilot mr . roy kenob an american ational\nmade a fixed deposit of u . s d 32 million in ned bank of south africa . on\nmaturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but gotno\nreply . after a month i sent a reminder and finally his employers\nwrote to inform us that mr . kenob died in a plane crash that he died without\nmaking a will while our attempt to trace his next of kin through american\nembassy proved fruitless .\nwhen he was making deposition in my bank he did not declare his next of\nkin in his deposit application form when i reminded him he said he\nwished it so in the conservative manner of our bank i did not turn down\nhis request rather honor it considering his high net worth . the point is\nthat his employer are not

emptive move to ensure liquidity - - - firm will pay debt keep cash cushion\nby wall street journal staff reporters john r . emshwiller rebecca smith and jathon sapsford\n10 26 2001\nthe wall street journal\ncl\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company inc . )\nenron corp . drew down about $ 3 billion the bulk of its available bank credit lines in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity .\nenron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $ 1 . 85 billion of outstanding commercial paper - - short - term corporate ious - - according to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion . some observers believe the move is a pre - emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted . the person also said enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion - dollar credit line .\nenron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong . but when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank said an enron spokesman . in a statement the company s new chief financial officer jeff mcmahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments . \nthe move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday for example enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit .\nsince early last week enron s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer andrew s . fastow who was replaced wednesday .\nthe draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency fitch put enron on review for a possible downgrade while another standard it takes time to sell assets particularly in today s slower economy .\nthe company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings a computerized search of the sec s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco .\nchewco was established in 1997 with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments to buy an interest in enron assets according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn t further specify what assets were purchased and it didn t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper a managing director in enron s global equity markets group according to the document .\nenron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed didn t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco .\nmr . kopper who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships didn t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco an enron spokesman would say only that michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july .\nthis statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 000 and involves any director or executive officer . by contrast mr . fastow as cfo would have fallen into that category but mr . kopper as managing director of a business unit presumably wouldn t have .\nhowever reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 a related -

rating concerns\nby jathon sapsford and suzanne mcgee\nstaff reporters of the wall street journal\n10 26 2001\nthe wall street journal\ncl 5\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company inc . )\nnew york - - enron corp . s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse .\nnot for long some bond traders say .\nin trading yesterday the houston company s five - year bond a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar down from a bid of 88 late wednesday and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks .\nthat is far less than the 50 % decline in enron s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit that kind of spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower .\nenron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday s 82 bid for instance was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds a small percentage of a typical trade .\nfueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles including losses a securities and exchange commission investigation and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer .\n even at these levels there s very little buying interest said harold rivkin a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton n . j .\nin one sign of the ripple effects the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a default swap - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company s troubles earlier during the year .\neven with its woes enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level .\nyet fitch said yesterday it put enron s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade following a similar move by moody s investors service last week . ( standard & poor s a division of mcgraw hill cos . stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to negative citing concerns about the company s financial flexibility . )\nmeanwhile the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels said glenn reynolds an analyst at credit sights inc . an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . they aren t distressed yet but they are headed in that direction . \nif enron s credit ratings fall it would have implications far beyond the company s ability to raise money . for an energy trader a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments .\nenron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber metals bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation s energy and gas markets .\nenron s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating the cheaper it can hedge or offset its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating the cost of this high - margin high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to or derived from that of an underlying security or asset such as a stock bond or commodity .\n even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron s counterparties - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - is going to be examining their exposure to enron and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it mr . reynolds said .\nto be sure enron despite its recent woes remains a strong company credit analysts said . i don t think anyone s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default mr . reynolds said .\n so far our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them said ron barone managing director of standard & poor s utility energy project finance group . no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it s business as usual . \nyet analysts say the arrival of distressed -

- critics would say blindly - - enthusiastic about enron even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits . now enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions which many on wall street still can t figure out .\nin a research note wednesday goldman sachs analyst david fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company . the company s lack of disclosure and transparency he says is a longstanding enron hallmark . \nso is this a stock to avoid in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its u . s . select list which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm s larger but prestigious recommended list of 200 or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 .\n just because i can t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can t analyze it or ` i can t figure it out says mr . fleischer who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . if that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn t follow . \nenron s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week .\n every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box says jim chanos principal of kynikos associates in new york who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . it was really a trust - me story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . \ntrue no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had .\nbut enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ?\nconcerns about the way that enron runs its business aren t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company s various partnership transactions .\nbesides those partnerships enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings .\nthrough it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling publicly dismissing questions about the firm s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday of the 17 analysts who following the stock 10 had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to thomson financial first call . five others rated the stock a buy though not strongly .\nonly prudential securities which downgraded the stock this week has a sell rating on enron .\nthe bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted .\nover the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index s general collapse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who like goldman s mr . fleischer own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue .\nenron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston enron retained seven co - managers including donaldson lufkin & jenrette lehman brothers and merrill lynch .\n enron is a big company and i don t think you re going to find a firm that hasn t been involved says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a $ 40 price target . they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . \nhe adds we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that s ludicrous . we re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . \nmr . fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small . but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients are happy to know he has a stake in enron because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is .\nin his research note wednesday mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position as an industry leader .\n there s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they re going to make their money but every quarter they do he says . it s hard to get inside to know all the transactions but they do deliver . \ncsfb s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday he wrote that he expects questions about enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . \n i know i m wrong on the stock mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices he isn t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares diluting current holders - - the stock doesn t have much further to fall .\nclearly messrs . launer and flesicher aren t alone . even in relative terms analysts remain very bullish on this stock says chuck hill director of research at thomson financial first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 or slightly shy of a buy rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 . this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out mr . hill says .\nin downgrading the stock this week prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to sell from buy with a brief stop at hold . while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock she openly concedes her recent downgrades come too little too late . \nms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal and senior executives are often evasive even when presented with direct questions . for instance she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said no she says .\nin light of the company s acknowledgment this week of an sec inquiry she asked enron about the previous denial . they told me it is an inquiry not an investigation she says . an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec s inquiry only last wednesday .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nenron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence\n2001 -

- an organization that as he noted he had represented as a lawyer for two decades - - mr . pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence .\nthe proof of course will come in the performance . fortunately the mess at enron gives the s . e . c . a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image . it will take time for the commission to determine if the company s accounting was proper . but there need be no delay in forcing enron to clearly explain - - rather than obfuscate as it has so far - - the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer .\n this could a former s . e . c . staff member said focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures . and it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite .\nphoto : harvey l . pitt\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nenron draws down at least 1 bln usd from credit lines to boost mkt confidence\n10 26 2001\nafx news\n( c ) 2001 by afp -

quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier there are no guarantees . amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth -

- short - term corporate ious - - according to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion . some observers believe the move is a pre - emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted . the person also said enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion - dollar credit line .\nenron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong . but when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank said an enron spokesman . in a statement the company s new chief financial officer jeff mcmahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments . \nthe move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday for example enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit .\nsince early last week enron s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer andrew s . fastow who was replaced wednesday .\nthe draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency fitch put enron on review for a possible downgrade while another standard it takes time to sell assets particularly in today s slower economy .\nthe company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings a computerized search of the sec s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco .\nchewco was established in 1997 with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments to buy an interest in enron assets according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn t further specify what assets were purchased and it didn t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper a managing director in enron s global equity markets group according to the document .\nenron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed didn t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco .\nmr . kopper who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships didn t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco an enron spokesman would say only that michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july .\nthis statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 000 and involves any director or executive officer . by contrast mr . fastow as cfo would have fallen into that category but mr . kopper as managing director of a business unit presumably wouldn t have .\nhowever reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 a related - party transaction involves a material piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors top officers vice presidents in charge of major business units and other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management . \ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\ndeals & deal makers : enron officials sell shares amid stock -

- enron corp . s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse .\nnot for long some bond traders say .\nin trading yesterday the houston company s five - year bond a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar down from a bid of 88 late wednesday and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks .\nthat is far less than the 50 % decline in enron s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit that kind of spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower .\nenron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday s 82 bid for instance was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds a small percentage of a typical trade .\nfueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles including losses a securities and exchange commission investigation and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer .\n even at these levels there s very little buying interest said harold rivkin a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton n . j .\nin one sign of the ripple effects the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a default swap - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company s troubles earlier during the year .\neven with its woes enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level .\nyet fitch said yesterday it put enron s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade following a similar move by moody s investors service last week . ( standard & poor s a division of mcgraw hill cos . stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to negative citing concerns about the company s financial flexibility . )\nmeanwhile the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels said glenn reynolds an analyst at credit sights inc . an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . they aren t distressed yet but they are headed in that direction . \nif enron s credit ratings fall it would have implications far beyond the company s ability to raise money . for an energy trader a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments .\nenron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber metals bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation s energy and gas markets .\nenron s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating the cheaper it can hedge or offset its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating the cost of this high - margin high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to or derived from that of an underlying security or asset such as a stock bond or commodity .\n even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron s counterparties - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - is going to be examining their exposure to enron and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it mr . reynolds said .\nto be sure enron despite its recent woes remains a strong company credit analysts said . i don t think anyone s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default mr . reynolds said .\n so far our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them said ron barone managing director of standard & poor s utility energy project finance group . no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it s business as usual . \nyet analysts say the arrival of distressed -

- critics would say blindly - - enthusiastic about enron even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits . now enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions which many on wall street still can t figure out .\nin a research note wednesday goldman sachs analyst david fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company . the company s lack of disclosure and transparency he says is a longstanding enron hallmark . \nso is this a stock to avoid in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its u . s . select list which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm s larger but prestigious recommended list of 200 or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 .\n just because i can t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can t analyze it or ` i can t figure it out says mr . fleischer who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . if that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn t follow . \nenron s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week .\n every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box says jim chanos principal of kynikos associates in new york who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . it was really a trust - me story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . \ntrue no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had .\nbut enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ?\nconcerns about the way that enron runs its business aren t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company s various partnership transactions .\nbesides those partnerships enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings .\nthrough it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling publicly dismissing questions about the firm s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday of the 17 analysts who following the stock 10 had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to thomson financial first call . five others rated the stock a buy though not strongly .\nonly prudential securities which downgraded the stock this week has a sell rating on enron .\nthe bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted .\nover the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index s general collapse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who like goldman s mr . fleischer own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue .\nenron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston enron retained seven co - managers including donaldson lufkin & jenrette lehman brothers and merrill lynch .\n enron is a big company and i don t think you re going to find a firm that hasn t been involved says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a $ 40 price target . they pay a lot of investment -

metals trader . the company also understands\ntransportation . it ships products as diverse as coal steel forest\nproducts and project cargo . now enron is proposing to change the face of\nover - the - road trucking and domestic intermodal services by treating\nthem as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product .\nthe company s enron freight markets unit promises to help shippers and\ncarriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and\nother shipping costs . enron will quote a set rate for dock - to - dock\nmoves and guarantee the service promised in the contract .\nenron freight markets was created in march to develop a market for\nfreight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in\ntransportation . as in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork\nbellies a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery\nof the service or closing out his position .\nenron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in\nenergy . can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight\ncapacity ? barry par - ker a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd . which\nspecializes in freight economics said it could work but that\ntransportation isn t like other markets . the marketplace needs these\nthings but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to\nthem parker said . i applaud what they are doing but it is an uphill\nbattle . \nenron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of\nwebmodal a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and\nlogistics services for carriers shippers and service providers . the\nformer webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight s 24 - hour\ncustomer service and operations center . this summer enron took another\nstep by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major\ntrucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales\ncontract with a major shipper but declined to identify it .\ndan reck vice president of enron freight markets said the company can\noffer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are\nconsiderably different from any others . what enron freight markets is\ntrying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the\nfreight market reck said .\na key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and\nconditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery\ntimes and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price\ncontracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges spikes in shipping volumes\nand fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only\nbecause it has deep pockets to make the market liquid but also by using\nits technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having\ncustomers sign long - term contracts .\n what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes\nmuch more clean and predictable reck said . so from a carrier s\nperspective they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece\nof their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are\nalso trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and\nconditions . \nenron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural\ngas and electric - power markets and is trying to change the way other\nmarkets such as steel are structured . efm sees transportation as\nanother commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or\nspeculation .\n we are kind of commodity - agnostic reck explained . we don t care what\nthe commodity is we just sell capacity . \nenron s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the\ntrucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte the former\nnational transportation exchange puts buyers and sellers directly\ntogether while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify\nthe most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike\nthe online services enron contracts directly with the party involved\nand does not wait for two to be matched up on its website .\nunder enron s ideal contract damages for non - performance are spelled\nout explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers\nmust be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example \nsuppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a\nshipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not\nprovide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the\ncarrier can find is 70 cents per mile enron pays the difference . the\nsame process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a\ntruck and didn t enron would provide a replacement at a higher price\nand the trucker would have to make up the difference .\nreck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but\nwould evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under\nway to introduce the company to shippers carriers and other\nintermediaries . enron officials say they ve talked with 400 to 500\nshippers since march .\none goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking\nassociation or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a\nforum for negotiations which the company believes would add legitimacy .\nin its first contract enron is acting as a carrier since the shipper\nalready was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron\nconsiders itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves\nand leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow\nparties to minimize risk for example by giving shippers the ability to\nhedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees .\nenron is an extensive user of the internet however and last year\nlaunched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas oil electricity\nand various other commodities online .\nno one expects enron s new freight capacity product to capture immediate\nacceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck\nsaid it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the\nfreight industry and that enron is prepared for that . we have done\nthat in every market we have gotten into reck said . what we find is\nthe economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance\nover time . you have to show what the benefits are . \njocoo 000 .\n( c ) copyright 2001 the journal of commerce inc . all rights reserved .\nhttp : www . joc . com .\nfolder name : rahil

did not have data on what they are owed nor an amount of refunds due them . contrary to the judge s claim a number of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts . wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fast - track status as california . ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together

the re - authorization caveat . murray s spokesman said the committee may have been concerned about bumping up against spending caps when it added the mandate for annual re - authorization . bonneville has warned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of 2003 unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of $ 3 . 75 billion - - the increase got through the senate energy & water development subcommittee but had the caveat added when it reached the full appropriations committee . increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs . we can expect to see more action coming out of sen . murray s office .\nrefunds : recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities ( including bpa ) seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting . this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings . if a bankruptcy court were to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg & e ( & potentially bankrupt socal . ed . ) it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of $ 70 m to $ 100 m . however while bpa s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the $ 167 million in gross sales they made from california\nbpa administration : the bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa s administrator . the entire northwest delegation ( democrats and republicans from the bpa region ) has asked that he be made the full

how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo .\ndsi aluminum smelter - load reduction agreements : bpa is in the hot seat right now realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources . few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year . consequently dsi s will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on prices ( which are still historically very high but dropping ) . currently there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations . alcoa is in preliminary talks with bc hydro to secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter and kaiser free from the money and the constraints of a load - reduction agreement is also attempting to restart plants . we will continuing monitoring

government to direct the bcuc to lift the rate freeze and before it can do that it has to schedule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the bcuc s purview . it has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing and people are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions about overall energy policy . a rate hearing will be delayed until the new government has completed its administrative core review and decided on a broader energy policy including its goals for bc hydro . lifting the rate freeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the rate stabilization account - this money has been redirected elsewhere over the past few years leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of low - water conditions that have surfaced this year . bc hydro wants the freeze lifted and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing the rate freeze given that it was put in place by the ndp and flouts free

. i really want to reinitiate the conversations marketpoint was having\nwith john goodpasture and you and he said either or both of you were the\nright people to continue after his responsibility shift . john was quite\npositive about the idea of enron acquiring marketpoint narg through license \nand he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that\ndirection after he handed it to you .\nwould this coming tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys ? if\nso please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on\nmy voicemail at ( 650 )

mention our power\nmodel ) . the progress is noticeable since you saw it . both long and short\nterm narg are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the\nmoment ranging from venezuelan

financings storage field evaluation and which new pipelines we can\nexpect to see enter and which are dogs .\ni really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually\nproductive

explanation that i was going to get it for shift work and i never check my paychecks in detail anyway .\nthanks for sitting with me in that meeting too . i had a good time working in real time .\nwork here is fine . it is a new market that enron is exploring that of paper and pulp and trading is fairly thin . i do market analysis for pulp traders and it includes intensive news - reading and passing on important info and gathering of the data and compiling spreadsheets creating graphs and so on . i like it a lot i take a lot of the reading home . i get to do some travelling too both in the us and overseas and i like that too . i like the people in my group and they help me when i don t know stuff . one good thing about being here is that there are a lot of classes offered and i am going to be in some of them .\ntexas is different for sure but we like it . yes it is hot but i feel like home . we have been out a bit and went to dallas last weekend to visit some cousins . there is a lot of spanish around here you hear it everywhere so i decided to learn it and i am going to start it this week twice a week . it s great beacuse when i learn new words i can practice with my latin co - workers .\nthat s pretty much it for now .\nwhen is evaluation taking place ? how are things there i bet much busier .\nlet me know \ncheers \nmonik\nSaskatonian metre wordhood ingredients divorces

summary\n? several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the edison mou .\n? a snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome .\nprocedural scenarios\nassembly\nthe assembly appropriations committee s plan to take up sb 78 xx today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full assembly on a party line vote . while the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of friday s draft bill it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend . if the problematic shaver lake provisions are removed from the bill assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill ( although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition ) . if the shaver lake amendments remain several central valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee .\nassembly speaker bob hertzberg supports this edison deal and the business community supports some recent amendments . this likely mitigates concerns from other pro - business democrats . with or without the shaver lake provisions hertzberg should get at least 41 democratic members ( and probably a few more ) but no more than 2 republicans ( if any ) to vote aye on the bill . hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass and there are 50 democrats in his caucus . if the vote is close a personal plea from him and or the governor should enable him to get to 41 .\nsenate\nthe bill would next move to the senate for approval of the assembly s amendments . this is where the prognosticating gets difficult . senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb 78 xx . gov . davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed ( due to a variety of factors ) and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position .\nthis would lead to one of four scenarios :\n? burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate and no edison mou bill is approved before sept . 15 th \n? burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition ( this option is unlikely ) \n? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill ( as it is passed by the assembly ) for a vote in the full senate with his support \n? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the assembly for more amendments and another vote in the assembly - before a vote in the senate .\njohn burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move . additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result . for instance the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue that burton cares more about resolving his way ( e . g . workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment ) . foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult . but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given burton s past actions he may string them along holding out for several days ( maybe even until sept . 14 th ) before he agrees to anything .\ngovernor\nassuming the bill escapes the senate ( and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes ) the governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of edison s public position . the bill will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs it .\nconsumer groups have vowed to undo any edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box . that could be either ( 1 ) an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb 78 xx and replacing it with other provisions or ( 2 ) a referendum to repeal sb 78 xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all .\ninitiative\nonce drafted and submitted to the attorney general it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary and another 25 days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary . after either the 15 or 40 days the attorney general sends it to the proponents the senate the assembly and the secretary of state . the day it is mailed is called the summary date . that is the day upon which all calculations are made .\nthe proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures . however the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters . therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on march 5 2002 ( statewide primaries ) and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on november 5 2002 . however the window is tight for that election as well and a proposal would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september 2001 to qualify for november 2002 .\nthe legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it . so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot . an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the preceding gubernatorial election ( 419 260 signatures ) . the ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers . it seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly but harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer & consumer rights has been successful at placing pro - consumer initiatives on the ballot before including prop . 9 in 1998 which sought to undo ab 1890 before the public understood its ramifications .\nreferendum\nreferenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives although a successful referendum was on the march 7 2000 ballot . prior to that the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the june 1982 primary election ballot . all four were defeated . since 1912 there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot . of the 50 attempts 39 qualified for the ballot 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect . the circulation calendar verification timing and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives . for example the california constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred . the signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute though .\npolitical dynamics\nnotwithstanding the governor s and assembly speaker s desire to enact an edison rescue package senate president pro tem john burton is in the driver s seat . in fact as noted above there is a perception among some that it is the governor who needs burton and not the other way around . one business source close to the negotiations believes burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an edison bailout . in fact members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility their reluctance fed by generators lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout .\ncurrently due largely to this dynamic and others such as the shaver lake issue there are not 41 votes for an edison rescue in the assembly . we believe this will change as the governor and the speaker exert their influence and the bill will pass the assembly . as difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the assembly the state senate presents an even larger challenge . however at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an edison rescue package being approved by the state

floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however with this amount of people in the area space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers .\nas tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants .\none area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however this number appears correct . also for the most part there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs filing cabinets credenzas etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from .\nthere is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul this was the area where telephones were answered for the

christi l .\nsubject : re : rto week - - summary of congestion management panel\nrto week\nday 2 - - october 16 2001\ncongestion management and transmission rights\nthe morning panel discussion was on congestion management . the panelists were : nancy brockway commissioner new hampshire psc ; reem fahey edison mission ; carol guthrie chevron texaco ; shmuel oren university of california - berkley and advises texas puc ; andy ott pjm ; michael schnitzer northbridge group .\ngeneral observations\nthe commissioners were again all present ( wood left mid - morning to give testimony on capitol hill ) . today however ferc staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions . the topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again . this will probably continue for the rest of the week . what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energy market based using lmp . very few panelists have opposed this ; at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized - - basically conceding that pjm s system will be implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else .\nlocational marginal pricing\nthe panelists all agreed that lmp in the real time market is necessary ( schmuel oren does not oppose it ) . most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across rtos . andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized . carol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect . she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works .\nftrs versus flowgates\nthe panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not physical . schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear . most of the panelists including the psc commissioner prefer ftrs rather than flowgates . schmuel is a flowgate advocate . after some discussion the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could work together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood . andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs ( liquidity standard product ) and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point - to - point rights then ftrs and flowgates can coexist . if a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay . however if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling the two cannot coexist . schmuel seemed to agree with this premise although this is not his preference . he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs . brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs .\nthe panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or flowgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not agreed upon .\nferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates . many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstances change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant . schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable .\nthe panelists agreed that these financial rights ( either ftrs or flowgates ) should be tradable in the secondary market . the panelists disagreed on which instrument - - ftrs or flowgates - - are more tradable . andy thinks ftrs are more tradable ; schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable .\noptions versus obligations\nthe panelists discussed the benefits of having ftrs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow . andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs being allocated . schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front .\nthe afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion . steve walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly .\nlet me know if you have any questions .\nsara\n", "Spam": "false", "File": "enronds//enron3/ham/3172.2001-10-17.kitchen.ham.txt"}, "Body": "fyi .\nclaudette and tj - - please

its stock but it looks like that case is far from unique .\nthe battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing enron . moreover enron s new cfo who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related - party dealings of his predecessor serves on 12 of these entities . and enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a houston - based related entity called es power 3 .\nthe extent of enron s dealings with these companies or the value of its holdings in them couldn t be immediately determined . but the existence of these partnerships could feed investors fears that enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don t show up on its balance sheet . if that s so the company s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on wall street where the company was long treated with kid gloves .\nenron didn t immediately respond to questions seeking details about es power or about the role of the chief financial officer jeff mcmahon in the various entities . enron s board members couldn t immediately be reached for comment .\nten long days\nenron s previous cfo andrew fastow was replaced by mcmahon wednesday after investors criticized fastow s role in a partnership called ljm which had done complex hedging transactions with enron . as details of this deal and two others emerged enron stock cratered .\nthe turmoil that resulted in fastow s departure began two weeks ago when enron reported third - quarter earnings that met estimates . however the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the ljm transactions . since then investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities . enron stock sank 6 % friday meaning it has lost 56 % of its value in just two weeks .\nenron s end run ?\nnew financial chief s involvement in enron business partners\nenron - related entity creation datemcmahon involved ?\nect strategic value corp

detox\nhowever enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities . the company has said nothing publicly about mcmahon s participation in related entities nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in es power 3 . ( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date january 1999 .\namong es power 3 s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay listed as a director and mcmahon and fastow listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn t immediately returned .\ndemands demands\nrating agencies moody s fitch and s & p recently put enron s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade or junk bonds suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .\nif enron s rating drops below investment grade it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off -

term investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months says jeff dietert power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . \ndietert outlines four challenges for enron . one management must regain the street s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .\nstraightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .\nalthough enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren t so sure . they re focused on the company s global assets portfolio sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .\nthe divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however enron has to execute here and given the current state of its affairs the seller will feel the pressure .\nthe credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings bbb + from standard & poor s and baal from moody s are three levels above non - investment grade . however both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron limiting enron s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . \nit s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it s a tough call that requires strict individual discipline .\nthere s an irony to this whole story especially in enron s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much -

profitable without a lot of gimmicks .\n our gut feel is that enron can pull it off and long - term investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months says jeff dietert power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . \ndietert outlines four challenges for enron . one management must regain the street s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .\nstraightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .\nalthough enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren t so sure . they re focused on the company s global assets portfolio sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .\nthe divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however enron has to execute here and given the current state of its affairs the seller will feel the pressure .\nthe credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings bbb + from standard & poor s and baal from moody s are three levels above non - investment grade . however both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron limiting enron s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . \nit s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it s a tough call that requires strict individual discipline .\nthere s an irony to this whole story especially in enron s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign enron looking to challenge conventional wisdom asks the simple question why ? ask why . \ninvestors are now asking . it s time for ken lay to answer .\nfirst things first\nmany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade .\nthe choice was easy . i m with him and my family .\nenjoy your weekend with family and friends .\ndj enron unit new england market downplay report of default\n2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york )\nby kristen mcnamara\nof dow jones newswires\nnew york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its\ncredit requirement in new england s wholesale power market this month but the\nevent was neither unique nor newsworthy the energy company and the\norganization that developed the market s rules said friday .\nthe operator of the region s wholesale power market informed enron energy\nservices last week that for the third time in 12 months it had traded a\ngreater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at\nrisk for expulsion from new england s market .\nbut it was administrative mixups rather than financial problems that\ntriggered the warning which a few other companies have also received in the\npast the market s rulemaker said .\n i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other\nparticipants that have defaulted on their credit agreements and it s never\nbeen in the news said david doot secretary and general counsel for the new\nengland power pool which developed the policies governing the region s\nelectricity market . my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of\nproportion . \nnews of the enron unit s default appeared in a trade publication and a major\nmetropolitan newspaper this week as enron s dealings with partnerships headed\nby its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company s\nstock and bond prices .\nenron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its\nbonding requirement twice before because both times it corrected the problem\nwithin a day spokeswoman peggy mahoney said .\nthe letter sent by iso new england which operates the region s power market \nto notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong\nperson delaying the company s response mahoney said .\n clearly it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to\nensure that we would never exceed the volume limit mahoney said .\nthe company resolved the problem by oct . 19 mahoney said . iso new england\nspokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its\ndefault .\nit s rare for a company to default three times but it has happened on\noccasion foley and doot said .\n i won t say it s commonplace but i won t say it s unusual for a participant\nto find itself out of compliance doot said . those things have in fact\nhappened from time to time . \n- by kristen mcnamara dow jones newswires ; 201 - 938 - 2061

retirement and 401 ( k ) plans .\nthe investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that under the law interpreting erisa enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans participants it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events .\non oct . 16 2001 enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by enron s cfo and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets .\nif you are a member of an enron

california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds .\nsafe to say that today s puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis and left his approach to solving california electricity crisis in shambles .\nwhat next ?\na broad left - right coalition of energy interests supported a bill ( 18 xx ) that passed the legislature with broad bi - partisan support .\nthe bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue .\nproponents of the bill - - and just about everyone else - - argue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget .\nthe bill is silent however on how california would pay for the dwr contracts and the bill s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result .\nall four puc commissioners who voted against the davis rate agreement today urged davis to sign the bill . the left - right coalition ( from nader types to oil companies ) is also working hard to get davis to sign it .\ndavis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the treasurer and bond counsel .\ngiven today s vote however davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid .\nupdate on edison bailout\nstill appears that chances are very small that edison and davis will succeed in getting the legislature to vote for an edison bailout when it returns for another special session next tuesday .\nif you have any questions just let us know

article\nfollowing is the computerworld article :\nlink :\nenron seeks to broker storage deals between users ssps\nby lucas mearian\nwhile technology service providers have long been talking about data storage\nas a utility that should be sold in the open marketplace like electricity or\nnatural gas little has been done to pool market resources in order to hawk\nsurplus disk - array capacity .\nbut that s exactly what a subsidiary of houston - based energy and\ncommunications conglomerate enron corp . is doing by launching a\nbusiness - to - business exchange that it said will seek to match spare capacity\nowned by storage service providers ( ssp ) with corporate users who want to be\nable to quickly scale up and down the amounts of storage they have available .\nenron broadband services this week announced that it has already signed a\ndeal with waltham mass . - based storagenetworks inc . and is negotiating\nsimilar agreements with at least six other ssps . if successful analysts\nsaid enron s business proposition could go far toward generating a set of\noperating standards for the emerging ssp business .\n it s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define\ntheir roles differently said ken weilerstein an analyst at gartner group\ninc . in stamford conn . enron s plan also could help enterprise - level users\nget additional benefits along with the storage capacity they re renting such\nas security and disaster recovery support he added .\nravi thuraisingham director of global bandwidth risk management at enron\nbroadband services said the new offering won t include additional security\nfeatures . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and\nbundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities \nhe said .\ninitially enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - -\nexpects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed\nstorage depending on market conditions and the length of time a company\nexpects to need the capacity . we re there to try to discover a market\nclearing price said thuraisingham adding that the service is tentatively\ndue to go online in the third quarter .\nenron said it has already signed best buy co . one of the leading retailers\nof consumer electronics computers and software in the u . s . to buy the\nstorage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management\napplication through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to\navailable storage could take anywhere from three days to three months \naccording to thuraisingham .\nunder enron s plan storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be\nconnected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company\ncurrently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching\ncenters or pooling points in the u . s . and another seven overseas .\nat first the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and\nother metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily\ninstalled . but even there thuraisingham said enron is pretty much in the\ninitial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . \nenron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since\nthe spring of 1999 . later that year it also launched a web site called\nenrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas electricity and other\ncommodities . that quickly became the world s largest e - commerce site and is\nnow said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily .\nnorman levine\nenron broadband services\n713 - 853 - 5010\nnorman _ levine @ enron . ne\n", "Spam": "false", "File":

seeks to broker storage deals between users ssps\nby lucas mearian\nwhile technology service providers have long been talking about data storage\nas a utility that should be sold in the open marketplace like electricity or\nnatural gas little has been done to pool market resources in order to hawk\nsurplus disk - array capacity .\nbut that s exactly what a subsidiary of houston - based energy and\ncommunications conglomerate enron corp . is doing by launching a\nbusiness - to - business exchange that it said will seek to match spare capacity\nowned by storage service providers ( ssp ) with corporate users who want to be\nable to quickly scale up and down the amounts of storage they have available .\nenron broadband services this week announced that it has already signed a\ndeal with waltham mass . - based storagenetworks inc . and is negotiating\nsimilar agreements with at least six other ssps . if successful analysts\nsaid enron s business proposition could go far toward generating a set of\noperating standards for the emerging ssp business .\n it s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define\ntheir roles differently said ken weilerstein an analyst at gartner group\ninc . in stamford conn . enron s plan also could help enterprise - level users\nget additional benefits along with the storage capacity they re renting such\nas security and disaster recovery support he added .\nravi thuraisingham director of global bandwidth risk management at enron\nbroadband services said the new offering won t include additional security\nfeatures . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and\nbundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities \nhe said .\ninitially enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - -\nexpects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed\nstorage depending on market conditions and the length of time a company\nexpects to need the capacity . we re there to try to discover a market\nclearing price said thuraisingham adding that the service is tentatively\ndue to go online in the third quarter .\nenron said it has already signed best buy co . one of the leading retailers\nof consumer electronics computers and software in the u . s . to buy the\nstorage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management\napplication through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to\navailable storage could take anywhere from three days to three months \naccording to thuraisingham .\nunder enron s plan storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be\nconnected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company\ncurrently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching\ncenters or pooling points in the u . s . and another seven overseas .\nat first the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and\nother metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily\ninstalled . but even there thuraisingham said enron is pretty much in the\ninitial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . \nenron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since\nthe spring of 1999 . later that year it also launched a web site called\nenrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas electricity and other\ncommodities . that quickly became the world s largest e - commerce site and is\nnow said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily .\nnorman
