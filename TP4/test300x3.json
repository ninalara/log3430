enron deal for now\nby janet whitman\nof dow jones newswires\n11 09 2001\ndow jones news service\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company inc . )\nnew york - ( dow jones ) - it s been a brutal year in the risk arbitrage business and that has many arbitrageurs also known as takeover traders steering clear of bets on dynergy inc . s ( dyn ) possible takeover of enron corp . ( ene ) .\nsome of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies .\nmore worrisome however is the possibility that enron - already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings - may have even deeper woes to report .\n unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world i don t see how a buyer could get comfortable . said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund .\nwhat worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change or mac clauses providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .\n as an investor it s hard for me to own something when i don t know what it is said the arbitrageur of enron . i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate but that s not enough for me . \nanother arbitrageur added if it gets announced it s a deal with a lot of issues starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud . \naccording to the wall street journal dynergy will swap nearly 0 . 27 of a share of its stock for each share of enron . also under the deal chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) which owns 26 % of dynergy will make an immediate cash injection of $ 1 . 5 billion into the deal and then add another billion on closing .\nshares of dynergy jumped more than 10 % in heavy trading bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal . its shares traded recently at $ 39 . 61 up $ 3 . 06 a share .\nan acquirer s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short while going long the target . in this case however arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy .\nenron meanwhile traded about 4 % higher recently swapping hands at $ 8 . 77 a share in heavy volume . the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody s . the firm downgraded enron s rating a notch to just above speculative not as bad as the junk rating some had feared .\ncopyright ?

gas trading business .\ncalgary - based transcanada which had been canada s biggest\ngas trader agreed last month to sell its trading units to bp plc\nand mirant corp . enron is canada s second - biggest gas trader .\non concerns the sale would reduce competition in gas trading :\n` ` in north america there are six or eight major gas traders\nthat are all highly competitive . the margins in gas trading have\nbecome very slim . it s extraordinarily difficult to manage and\nadminister monitoring the risks and ensuring that things aren t\ngoing wrong . \n` ` that is one tough business to stay on top of . we re frankly\nglad to be out of it . \n` ` we don t think the acquisition of enron by some other\nplayer would bring too much market concentration into one party s\nhands . \n` ` we think there are many other players in the gas marketing\nand trading arena that are very capable of growing their\nbusinesses and making sure competition will be there . \non the decision to sell its gas - trading units :\n` ` one of the reasons that we decided to exit the trading\nsector was that the barriers to entry were few . \n` ` if you go back 15 years ago transcanada had a 100 percent\nshare of the gas that was exported from alberta other than the\nvolume that went to california . as the market opened enron was\none of the earliest to enter but certainly many others have\nentered over time . \n", "Spam": "false", "File": "enronds//enron3/ham/3893.2001-11-09.kitchen.ham.txt"}}, {"mail": {"Subject": " business trip to houston", "From": "kaminski@paris.com", "Date": "2000-07-07", "Body": "dear all \ni will be in the houston office from monday 10 th july through wednesday 19 th\njuly and stopping in ny on the return leg to meet staff at mg metals ny on\nthursday 20 th july at the suggestion of lloyd fleming who is co -

enron deal for now\nby janet whitman\nof dow jones newswires\n11 09 2001\ndow jones news service\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company inc . )\nnew york - ( dow jones ) - it s been a brutal year in the risk arbitrage business and that has many arbitrageurs also known as takeover traders steering clear of bets on dynergy inc . s ( dyn ) possible takeover of enron corp . ( ene ) .\nsome of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies .\nmore worrisome however is the possibility that enron - already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings - may have even deeper woes to report .\n unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world i don t see how a buyer could get comfortable . said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund .\nwhat worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change or mac clauses providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .\n as an investor it s hard for me to own something when i don t know what it is said the arbitrageur of enron . i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate but that s not enough for me . \nanother arbitrageur added if it gets announced it s a deal with a lot of issues starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud . \naccording to the wall street journal dynergy will swap nearly 0 . 27 of a share of its stock for each share of enron . also under the deal chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) which owns 26 % of dynergy will make an immediate cash injection of $ 1 . 5 billion into the deal and then add another billion on closing .\nshares of dynergy jumped more than 10 % in heavy trading bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal . its shares traded recently at $ 39 . 61 up $ 3 . 06 a share .\nan acquirer s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short while going long the target . in this case however arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy .\nenron meanwhile traded about 4 % higher recently swapping hands at $ 8 . 77 a share in heavy volume . the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody s . the firm downgraded enron s rating a notch to just above speculative not as bad as the junk rating some had feared .\ncopyright ?

gas trading business .\ncalgary - based transcanada which had been canada s biggest\ngas trader agreed last month to sell its trading units to bp plc\nand mirant corp . enron is canada s second - biggest gas trader .\non concerns the sale would reduce competition in gas trading :\n` ` in north america there are six or eight major gas traders\nthat are all highly competitive . the margins in gas trading have\nbecome very slim . it s extraordinarily difficult to manage and\nadminister monitoring the risks and ensuring that things aren t\ngoing wrong . \n` ` that is one tough business to stay on top of . we re frankly\nglad to be out of it . \n` ` we don t think the acquisition of enron by some other\nplayer would bring too much market concentration into one party s\nhands . \n` ` we think there are many other players in the gas marketing\nand trading arena that are very capable of growing their\nbusinesses and making sure competition will be there . \non the decision to sell its gas - trading units :\n` ` one of the reasons that we decided to exit the trading\nsector was that the barriers to entry were few . \n` ` if you go back 15 years ago transcanada had a 100 percent\nshare of the gas that was exported from alberta other than the\nvolume that went to california . as the market opened enron was\none of the earliest to enter but certainly many others have\nentered over time . \n", "Spam": "false", "File": "enronds//enron3/ham/3893.2001-11-09.kitchen.ham.txt"}}, {"mail": {"Subject": " business trip to houston", "From": "kaminski@paris.com", "Date": "2000-07-07", "Body": "dear all \ni will be in the houston office from monday 10 th july through wednesday 19 th\njuly and stopping in ny on the return leg to meet staff at mg metals ny on\nthursday 20 th july at the suggestion of lloyd fleming who is co -
