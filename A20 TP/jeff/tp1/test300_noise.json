slides as equity reduction digested reuters english news service brazil s copene elektro plan to sell mln reais of bonds bloomberg enron cuts shareholder equity by bln usd due to partnership deal afx news c by afp extel news ltd london afx enron corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by bln usd as the company decided to repurchase mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer andrew fastow the wall street journal reported in its online edition enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on tuesday when the houston based energy giant announced a bln usd charge to third quarter earnings that produced a mln usd loss however the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday as a result of the reduction enron s shareholder equity dropped to bln usd the company said in an interview enron chairman kenneth lay said about mln usd of the bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with ljm co investment lp a limited partnership created and run by fastow in a conference call yesterday with investors lay said mln shares had been repurchased by enron as the company unwound its participation in the transactions in the third quarter the company s average number of shares outstanding was mln according to rick causey enron s chief accounting officer these shares were contributed to a structured finance vehicle set up about two years ago in which enron and ljm were the only investors in exchange for the stock the entity provided enron with a note the aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of enron s broadband telecommunications and other technology investments causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took subsequently both the value of enron s stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply the report said as a result enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares when enron reacquired the shares it also canceled the note it had received from the entity given all the complexities of the ljm related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company the confusion factor wasn t worth the trouble of trying to continue this causey said mark palmer an enron spokesman described the capital reduction as just a balance sheet issue and therefore was not deemed material for disclosure purposes gc for

reuters limited houston oct reuters enron corp stock fell sharply on thursday as investors digested news of a billion reduction in the energy giant s shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week in afternoon trading enron s stock was off or percent at per share enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on tuesday after taking charges of billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations the reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company s earnings statement but was discussed by chairman and chief executive ken lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on tuesday confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure this is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much said one analyst who asked not to be identified the reduction in equity was prominently reported in the wall street journal on thursday bringing it to the attention of a wider audience analysts said lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some wall street analysts as a result of the operation enron s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about percent but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around percent by the end of next year lay said moody s investor service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron s long term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially

as a commodity transportation as a commodity by bill hensel jr joc week copyright c the journal of commerce inc all rights reserved enron corp the houston based energy giant is familiar with commodity markets in addition to energy the business for which it is best known enron is the world s largest metals trader the company also understands transportation it ships products as diverse as coal steel forest products and project cargo now enron is proposing to change the face of over the road trucking and domestic intermodal services by treating them as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product the company s enron freight markets unit promises to help shippers and carriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and other shipping costs enron will quote a set rate for dock to dock moves and guarantee the service promised in the contract enron freight markets was created in march to develop a market for freight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in transportation as in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork bellies a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery of the service or closing out his position enron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in energy can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight capacity barry par ker a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd which specializes in freight economics said it could work but that transportation isn t like other markets the marketplace needs these things but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them parker said i applaud what they are doing but it is an uphill battle enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers shippers and service providers the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight s hour customer service and operations center this summer enron took another step by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper but declined to identify it dan reck vice president of enron freight markets said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market reck said a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions the standardized areas would include specific delivery times and specific consequences for non performance fixed price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long term contracts what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be comes much more clean and predictable reck said so from a carrier s perspective they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business there are very clean operational parameters we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric power markets and is trying to change the way other markets such as steel are structured efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation we are kind of commodity agnostic reck explained we don t care what the commodity is we just sell capacity enron s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology based intermediaries nte the former national transportation exchange puts buyers and sellers directly together while logistics com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost effective matches between shippers and carriers unlike the online services enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website under enron s ideal contract damages for non performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract for example suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is cents per mile enron pays the difference the same process would work in reverse if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn t enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers carriers and other intermediaries enron officials say they ve talked with to shippers since

negotiations bpa financials smelter agreements bc hydro rate freeze power refunds the big event that happened last week in washington dc in regards to california and the rest of the western energy markets was that multi party negotiations that flopped apparently the difference between billion and million between parties could not be settled below is a rough breakdown corporate offerings williams duke reliant dynegy mirant million combined powerex bc hydro million power marketers including enron million california municipal utilities million load serving entities outside ca million northwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges however judge curtis wagner has virtually ignored northwest claims of million in overcharges stating there was little time to address the issues raised by the pacific northwest parties they did not have data on what they are owed nor an amount of refunds due them contrary to the judge s claim a number of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fast track status as california ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together and applied some pressure the result was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together below is another rough breakdown of the claims pacificcorp million snohomish pud million tacoma power million seattle city light million port of seattle million bpa million bpa bpa borrowing sen patty murray d wa has been leading the fight for bpa s request of b in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the senate voted to increase access to additional funds however sen murray has promised to fight the re authorization caveat murray s spokesman said the committee may have been concerned about bumping up against spending caps when it added the mandate for annual re authorization bonneville has warned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of billion the increase got through the senate energy water development subcommittee but had the caveat added when it reached the full appropriations committee increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs we can expect to see more action coming out of sen murray s office refunds recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities including bpa seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings if a bankruptcy court were to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg e potentially bankrupt socal ed it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of m to m however while bpa s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the million in gross sales they made from california bpa administration the bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa s administrator the entire northwest delegation democrats and republicans from the bpa region has asked that he be made the full time administrator however since many of the decision makers at doe are conservative republicans they re not comfortable with him because he is a democrat at this time doe people are unsure of how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo dsi aluminum smelter load reduction agreements bpa is in the hot seat right now realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year consequently dsi s will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on prices which are still historically very high but dropping currently there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations alcoa is in preliminary talks with bc hydro to secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter and kaiser free from the money and the constraints of a load reduction agreement is also attempting to restart

ability to change counterparties names after bridge back impact to logistics unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place one problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yet edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month can t remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force re pathing unify does have the ability to over ride duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response what are if any impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods re pathing i have a call into diane and dave both after speaking w them hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact i am sure we ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are

to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however i did add a warning message warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems pre unify some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline sorry i don t know

scenarios assembly the assembly appropriations committee s plan to take up sb xx today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full assembly on a party line vote while the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of friday s draft bill it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend if the problematic shaver lake provisions are removed from the bill assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition if the shaver lake amendments remain several central valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee assembly speaker bob hertzberg supports this edison deal and the business community supports some recent amendments this likely mitigates concerns from other pro business democrats with or without the shaver lake provisions hertzberg should get at least democratic members and probably a few more but no more than republicans if any to vote aye on the bill hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus he needs votes for the bill to pass and there are democrats in his caucus if the vote is close a personal plea from him and or the governor should enable him to get to senate the bill would next move to the senate for approval of the assembly s amendments this is where the prognosticating gets difficult senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb xx gov davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed due to a variety of factors and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position this would lead to one of four scenarios burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate and no edison mou bill is approved before sept th burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition this option is unlikely burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill as it is passed by the assembly for a vote in the full senate with his support burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill thereby sending it back to the assembly for more amendments and another vote in the assembly before a vote in the senate john burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result for instance the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue that burton cares more about resolving his way e g workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given burton s past actions he may string them along holding out for several days maybe even until sept th before he agrees to anything governor assuming the bill escapes the senate and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes the governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of edison s public position the bill will go into effect days after the governor signs it consumer groups have vowed to undo any edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box that could be either an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb xx and replacing it with other provisions or a referendum to repeal sb xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all initiative once drafted and submitted to the attorney general it takes days to receive an official title and summary and another days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary after either the or days the attorney general sends it to the proponents the senate the assembly and the secretary of state the day it is mailed is called the summary date that is the day upon which all calculations are made the proponents are allowed a maximum of days to circulate petitions and collect signatures however the initiative measure must qualify at least days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on march statewide primaries and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on november however the window is tight for that election as well and a proposal would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september to qualify for november the legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the

in eb cl beginning noon lunch will be served and yvette has drinks and snacks throughout the day our goal will be not to have dinner but if necessary we will i suggest each of you to make arrangements to stay as late as needed to ensure we reach a quality work product our agenda review of ground rules and responsibilities of the committee each of you will provide a general business assessment of your team hr challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets gap analysis and succession planning the template below should be used for the format i am not interested in discussing the business goals but you probably need to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want to discuss as a group review and discussion of exempt employees each will be categorized into the six descriptors used in the feedback process i am expecting each of you to have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into appropriate categories i would like to stress that the data to sustantiate the performance descriptor should be factual and documented the focus of employee discussions must be on each employee s individual contribution towards accomplishing our business goals we must safeguard our discussions from he said she said periferal distractors and focus on the work product promotion candidates discussion once again the prc process is a valued process at enron each of you have been through it so you understand the importance of confidentiality additionally the committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote please come to the meeting with your enron hat on not your individual group hat our people are critical to our business therefore it is important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff we must identify our stengths and weaknesses and work towards strengthening our people to ensure the very best business service we can provide what this means is that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback possible in some cases you may be providing a tough message but it is our responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands expectations where they are on point and where they are not on point of meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build needed skill sets and or correct behaviors this is your obligation as their immediate supervisor if you have any questions concerns or issues you would like to talk about prior to the meeting on

individual groups under sally will probably set their deadlines prior to the smaller prc s that is correct i did not understand that promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting with sally our notes indicate that sally wanted some prior discussions on this subject nor did i understand that the employee had to be in their role for year our notes indicate that this would be the general rule of thumb i thought the promotion discussion would be an agenda item of prc we believe that discussion of promotions will also occur at the prc additionally i understood the mid year promotion listing would not be as extensive as year end maintaining the year end as the primary promotion time we understood the same from brenda f herod ect pm to hector mcloughlin corp enron enron cc sally beck hou

                "Body": "executive summary the likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below but also because the day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today which it is believed will happen and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing or even the threat of one this bail out plan will be enacted quickly utilities vs cpuc governor davis attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed the case will come before the judge on monday february th the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities however the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting kwh this will be left to an appellate court the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing by the smaller ipps as noted in our reports last week or by larger out of state generators such as duke reliant and dynegy as noted in the press this morning this is expected next week or the week after prospects for a bailout bill ab x is effectively dead from lack of support senator burton despite his public refusals is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail out the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear for burton this is because of his long association with labor unions the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state but with some kind of state support but less than full faith and credit of the state of ca which would not pass this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills e g though the actual amount is not known these bonds would be asset backed securities with payment receivable from rate payers the term of these bonds is unknown if the term is made quite long e g years the associated rate increase could be very small the state would purchase the utilities transmission assets for a very high price the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today which it is believed will happen and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing or even the threat of one sources believe that this bail out plan will be enacted quickly as noted in an earlier report the california legislature habitually does not act until things hit the wall it is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton s lead and support the bail out plan the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail out in her central valley district is to however an involuntary filing or the threat thereof may be enough to trigger legislative support it would allow the argument of an imminent threat to the people of the state of california consumer opposition harvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum if the referendum fails he intends to attack individual legislators though not john burton who reportedly has immunity from rosenfield some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail out plan then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later however if the bail out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill rather than put in place by the puc for example it cannot be reversed by a referendum as additional insurance against rosenfield by supporting the bonds issued under the plan the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan while it is not clear that this is a factual argument it still might impede any referendum destoor

will lloyd lindberg susan gupta gautam misra narsimha scheuer janelle baughman edward d herndon rogers cc nicolay christi l subject re rto week summary of congestion management panel rto week day october congestion management and transmission rights the morning panel discussion was on congestion management the panelists were nancy brockway commissioner new hampshire psc reem fahey edison mission carol guthrie chevron texaco shmuel oren university of california berkley and advises texas puc andy ott pjm michael schnitzer northbridge group general observations the commissioners were again all present wood left mid morning to give testimony on capitol hill today however ferc staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions the topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again this will probably continue for the rest of the week what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energy market based using lmp very few panelists have opposed this at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized basically conceding that pjm s system will be implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else locational marginal pricing the panelists all agreed that lmp in the real time market is necessary schmuel oren does not oppose it most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across rtos andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized carol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works ftrs versus flowgates the panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not physical schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference unclear most of the panelists including the psc commissioner prefer ftrs rather than flowgates schmuel is a flowgate advocate after some discussion the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could work together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs liquidity standard product and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point to point rights then ftrs and flowgates can coexist if a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay however if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling the two cannot coexist schmuel seemed to agree with this premise although this is not his preference he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs the panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or flowgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not agreed upon ferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstances change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable the panelists agreed that these financial rights either ftrs or flowgates should be tradable in the secondary market the panelists disagreed on which instrument ftrs or flowgates are more tradable andy thinks ftrs are more tradable schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable options versus obligations the panelists discussed the benefits of having ftrs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs being allocated schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front the afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion steve walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly let me know if you

board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a houston based related entity called es power the extent of enron s dealings with these companies or the value of its holdings in them couldn t be immediately determined but the existence of these partnerships could feed investors fears that enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don t show up on its balance sheet if that s so the company s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on wall street where the company was long treated with kid gloves enron didn t immediately respond to questions seeking details about es power or about the role of the chief financial officer jeff mcmahon in the various entities enron s board members couldn t immediately be

hedging transactions with enron as details of this deal and two others emerged enron stock cratered the turmoil that resulted in fastow s departure began two weeks ago when enron reported third quarter earnings that met estimates however the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a billion charge to equity related to unwinding the ljm transactions since then investors and

power nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars related names by the related party companies it s not immediately clear what es power is or does so far subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power and its formation date january among es power s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay listed as a director and mcmahon and fastow listed as executive vice presidents a raft of external directors are named as es power directors including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan chairman of the hong kong based hang lung group a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn t immediately returned demands demands rating agencies moody s fitch and s p

not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to edison s svp of regulatory affairs and here s a summary the commission will keep current rates in place through any overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off b in edison s past due accounts the so called undercollection if edison collects the b prior to then rates can change if edison has not collected the b by the end of the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder half the remainder will be collected in and the other half in any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the b undercollection edison can keep of any refunds received after the b is paid off edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the b edison can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price risk edison will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs i e if dwr s costs go up the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of edison s rates the puc will not fine edison during this period if edison s capital structure varies from the puc approved capital structure edison must drop its lawsuits against the puc regarding the filed rate doctrine and the so called turn accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place edison agrees to cooperate with the attorney general and the puc in all litigation against suppliers the puc decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the governor recently announced we will report back with additional details

davis proposed rate agreement with dwr in what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event the california puc today voted down davis proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc the vote was with the two republicans voting with davis hand picked appointees lynch and wood davis proposal was introduced at the meeting by another davis appointee geoff brown who made a lengthy speech about why california would experience economic and political destruction if the puc did not approve davis proposed rate agreement what is davis proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc it would remove all puc authority to review any contracts between dwr with suppliers it would require the puc to pass through to utility rates all dwr power contract costs no questions asked what are the implications of the move by the puc to reject davis proposal with the vote it remains unclear how california dwr will pay for the dwr power contracts the political pressure to re negotiate or break the dwr power contracts is likely to intensify considerably it remains unclear how california dwr will pay for the b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months under the structure devised by davis the revenues flowing from the cpuc dwr rate agreement would be used to both pay for the dwr power contracts and service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay california s general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since january in short there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds safe to say that today s puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis and left his approach to solving california electricity crisis in shambles what next a broad left right coalition of energy interests supported a bill xx that passed the legislature with broad bi partisan support the bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue proponents of the bill and just about everyone else argue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget the bill is silent however on how california would pay for the dwr contracts and the bill s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result all four puc commissioners who

management team a strong management team is the most important critical ingredient to creating future shareholder value vspc has a strong management team see below large rapidly growing markets in general to increase shareholder value a company must participate in rapidly growing markets and should try to be a significant player in targeted markets vspc expects to dominate billion dollar markets that do not exist today by introducing believe it or not technology innovations that create and expand markets breakthrough products in the vspc pipeline vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to hours of laptop computer usage and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells gps free navigation especially for places where gps doesn t work a top dod priority automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x ray imaging homeland security identification of narcotics chemicals and biological weapons another total breakthrough with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable carry on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time further miniaturization is expected to shoebox

powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between billion on the low side to billion on the high side that market does not exist today vspc s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well known razor razor blade model which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business the fuel cell is a razor and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade another analogy is the flashlight battery model imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the flashlight the fuel cell and intends to sell the flashlight battery specifically disposable fuel cartridges for an end user price of each vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well known major plants in the far east intellectual property protected with patents vspc s fuel cell technology for example is protected by over issued and pending patents strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost effective worldwide footprint emerging companies must partner with branded global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources vspc is partnering with major well known market leaders who have management resources and global branding partners are attracted to vspc s technology and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented proprietary technology obtained from vspc for example in the fuel cell business toshiba nec sanyo hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology
