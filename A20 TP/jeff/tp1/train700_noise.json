unachievable on their own c will get addicted to this new business and d have very little to loose with their alternative being partnering with our closest competitor the choice for these guys is to grow or not they will not loose what they had before ena i know our role for the unforeseeable future will be that of a broker even on mgu i am attempting to find a way to mitigate their concerns with

message from penman gregg sent thursday november am to luce laura tomaski richard dickson stacy e johnson rudwell subject fw enovate wps winter deal it looks like we may have worked out an arrangement for the wpsc deal essentially pec will provide the full guarantee ena will give pec a reimbursement agreement for and ena will receive under bankruptcy of the deal proceeds in exchange we may need to cover a small few hundred thousand dollars shortfall on the th of november this would most likely be accomplished by not cash settling a portion of the transactions and instead delaying payment until enovate has the cash i am working out the details of whether or not this is feasible any questions please let me know i will let you know if we hit any road bumps but we are going to try to close this

which will go to if they are not under bankruptcy in addition enron is subject to final management approval going to cover a small cash shortfall that enovate anticipates having during november due to

                "Body": "received the following additional information late yesterday from speaker hertzberg s chief of staff regarding direct access in the legislation working its way through the assembly he relayed the information during an informational hearing that an assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in sacramento see previous note attached below for more a detailed description of da provisions in the bill a new print of the bill is likely to be issued today with respect to da the governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of da in the bill assembly ds and other market participants lobbied him hard explaining that since the bill covers all costs of bonds and dwr contracts through exit fees there is no reason to suspend da the governor is resisting hard stating that he wants time for the market to stabilize so it looks like the governor s plan is to have a bill that provides for direct access as of and have the puc temporarily suspend da from september to we re continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate or significantly shorten the suspension the bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by august yesterday will not be responsible for any dwr going forward contracts the customer will have to pay for any power consumed that dwr purchased on the ious behalf between jan and the date of the switch the bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and sept be responsible for dwr going forward contracts though details of how that would work were not clear the stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the august rd date is to prevent a rush to direct access between now and sept there are currently no efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to sept finally the bill apparently will also give self generation priority over direct access in each open season the bill would set aside mw of the short position each year for customers to do self gen if the self gen is not subscribed the mws would go to da the bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released today the bill will be heard in the assembly committee on monday afternoon we continue to work with the business customers to improve the da and self gen provisions it remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the assembly the politicians are very reluctant to pass any edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing but the governor is working the bill very hard mirant is actively working against the bill mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose re election mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes the bill also has to make it through the senate our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the senate president john burton who said flatly that he s not doing anything but there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of burton doing a deal is with respect to the bill s provisions preventing edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component included edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers edison also said that under the assembly version of the bill edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds more info to follow as it becomes available if anyone has any questions don t hesitate to contact me best jeff original message from dasovich jeff sent wednesday august pm to dasovich jeff subject latest legislative version of direct access the following is a summary of the direct access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that davis cut with assembly things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly i was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the davis and hertzberg s staff and the staff have agreed to amend the da provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers they also said that favorable provisions with respect to self gen would also be added to the bill they said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow note in addition to the da provisions the bill also includes provisions that explicitly recognize the px credit as part of edison s undercollection and permit edison to pay debts associated with the negative px credit the bill does not authorize edison to pay power suppliers however and leaves that portion of edison s debt for edison s management and shareholders to address summary of direct access provisions the program would begin january it s unclear what would happen to da between now and january presumably the decision to suspend or not between now and then would stay with the california puc days after

bloomberg usa dynegy sees no more nasty surprises from enron by andrew kelly reuters english news service c reuters limited houston nov reuters dynegy inc said on monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from enron corp slammed by news of murky off balance sheet transactions that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant however dynegy said it can drop its billion offer if more bad news emerges or if pending lawsuits against enron lead to more than billion in costs dynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on friday will win u s regulatory approval i really have a good deal of confidence but not an absolute guarantee that we are going to be fine here said dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by enron watson said dynegy had run the deal through worst case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense investors apparently agreed bidding up dynegy shares or percent to close at on the new york stock exchange enron shares gained cents to percent to the deal valued enron stock at enron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems including a u s regulatory probe into the off balance sheet dealings a billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades watson has cause for concern about new disclosures from enron which last thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some million since in a conference call with analysts on monday dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company including annual projected earnings per share growth of percent to percent over the next three years but they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed enron s market value last week to barely one tenth the almost billion it was valued in august dynegy doubts huge liabilities to ensure against unpleasant disclosures dynegy wrote so called material adverse change clauses into the deal allowing it to walk away from enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets in particular dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against enron including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune leads to costs of more than billion chief financial officer rob doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached even if a very substantial settlement was reached in the stockholder suits commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from enron was over i think dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that enron has had he said but ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal he was reassured it could address tough questions a breath of fresh air after enron s tight lipped response to investors some analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that dynegy would be too powerful after merging with enron currently north america s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity watson said dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators led by the federal energy regulatory commission but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster we really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in

                "Body": "at its special meeting today ferc released the results of its eagerly awaited probe into california s summer power crisis concluding that under certain circumstances california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california s seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer price abormalities entitled part i of staff report on u s bulk power markets is available at the following website in response ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems and solicited public comment by november a technical conference has also been scheduled for november to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested details tba while all four commissioners supported the order the order stretched the commission chairman hoecker and comm breathitt expressed strong endorsements while comms hebert and massey concurred citing areas where they felt the commission had either over reached or not gone far enough as discussed below a final order is expected to be issued by year s end at the same time the commission warned california consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues such as immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases development of demand responses siting of generation and transmission and assurance of sufficient reserve requirements highlights of proposed california structural remedy in its order ferc proposed a series of market overhauls including eliminating the state s mandatory requirement that the state s investor owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks requiring market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the day ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under scheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage over reliance on the real time spot market establishing independent non stakeholder governing boards for the iso and px modifying the current single price auction system by a imposing a temporary mwh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of from setting the market clearing price for all bidders b requiring sellers bidding above mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support and c requiring the iso and px to report monthly information on such bids the commission s price mitigation measures would remain in effect through december declining to order retroactive refunds for the state s ratepayers and utilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from october until december but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if ferc finds non competitive behavior encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs separately the draft order rejected the iso s request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority and the px s request for price capping authority commissioner responses comm herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the november meeting he stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas eliminate all price controls in california markets abolish the single price auction entirely terminate the buy and sell mandate in the px and direct the iso to address a long list of cited problems in its january rto filing rather than having the commission prescribe specific remedies hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap concept if one had to be adopted then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific pre announced dates he believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for california regulators to address market design and other flaws also he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january rto filings in addition he would not dictate risk management methods preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own finally he advised californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity comm breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets she noted that it was the commission s job to guide the market to self correct and not to conduct command and control she also commended the managers of the iso and px saying that they have performed admirably however she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements comm massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach he feels that the congress has put its thumb on the scale in the federal power act

mtg summary key planning assumptions jan go live new co conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by jan this assumes all major production data setup users rights books global data is completed and tested on a per application basis some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from eol to sap through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work we will not be testing functional permutations data conditions validation or exceptions to any significant degree each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing we are operating from the premise that data infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts all systems will be physically split even unify at this point integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both estate and new co we will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production we will minimize the differentiation between new co and estate for conversion and test team purposes there are two teams conversion and integration test each team will focus on both estate and new co resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest estate conversion is on the critical path for new co key issues we will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first then physical if financial is the focus delivery risk goes down dramatically for now we must plan on the worst case physical and financial on jan we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate this means that we need a dev environment and hw gap addressed for unify sitara cpr tagg erms conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we re in synch unify servers probably can t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify some systems are using short name instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global the global tagg erms unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one

                "Body": "cera alert december title california on the brink cera knowledge areas western energy n american power n american gas california on the brink the california stalemate california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over credit worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the california market while numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california s utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation the current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation the collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases the california public utilities commission denied the requests of pacific gas electric and southern california edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy this has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry however there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled in the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible that as has largely been the case so far the steps taken will fail to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws in the six months since california s supply shortfall began plaguing western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage establishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responses efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions these include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process medicine worse than the illness several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall the void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of california s electric market woes challenging siting and permitting despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities price caps discourage investment state and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state repeated rule changes frequent rule changes in the iso markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development calls for refunds despite reports by the power exchange the iso and the ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the california markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development facility inspections recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust cera s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west are not guaranteed to make a profit prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficult to forecast factors california s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limited term capacity payment cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in in addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall encourage new build supply must be part of the answer this requires a series of

stokes unease among allies and international press with call for bin ladin to be brought to the u s dead or alive taliban offers to deliver bin ladin to a third country likely a muslim country offer almost certain to be rejected by bush administration fbi arrests five additional suspected hijackers raising expectations for further attacks u s officials to meet with saudi foreign minister in washington questions to be asked about involvement of sons of saudi diplomat in attacks analysis efforts by the bush administration to build a multilateral coalition against terrorism will have to address two key foreign policy issues iraq and the israel palestinian peace process missteps in either area could weaken the emerging multilateral coalition against terrorism and have important implications for the oil market for a multilateral approach to work in the long term the administration will need to provide countries with incentives to cooperate in the anti terrorism campaign especially in places such as the moderate arab states where dismantling the networks suspected of supporting terrorist groups will involve moving against internal targets moreover the administration will need to deal with the root causes that provide willing cadres to extremist groups especially economic problems and political disenfranchisement dealing with all of these factors will necessitate us financial support as well as greater us imagination in dealing with lingering regional issues policy towards iraq washington appears to be resisting attempts to broaden its attacks to include iraq at this point despite internal and external pressure for such action this will be a leading indicator assuming that no firm proof of baghdad s involvement in the bombings is uncovered a more aggressive us approach towards iraq has seemed likely since july when moscow blocked the introduction of smart sanctions during the last rollover of the oil for food program however given regional sensitivities in the arab world to washington s iraq policy and the interests that states such as russia and to a lesser extent china have in the country the bush administration cannot have both a genuinely multilateral approach to anti terrorism and an unilateral hard line iraqi policy it will need to chose between one or the other israeli palestinian peace process without an equitable solution to this conflict most experts believe that the bush team s anti terrorism coalition is doomed to failure initially at least the signs are not good the sharon government in israel has been resistant to us pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the palestinians washington s willingness to confront israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the anti terrorism course and hold its broad coalition together market update us equities next hours seen as critical after yesterday s losses and fed cut on dow seen as key resistance point looking for

still shopping around to find a good seller since the load reduction agreement with bpa is still in effect it should be noted that bc s premier gordon campbell has had long standing poor relations with alcan inc of canada a competitor of alcoa s while in the opposition campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a b hydroelectric power project earlier this year bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with he will likely do so to that end look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it alcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements in a recent shareholder meeting last week alcoa s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re establishing revenue growth kaiser aluminum with the hiring of harvey perry as the company s new aluminum chief kaiser s long term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear as the only dsi to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with bpa they are still in discussions if anything new arises we will keep you updated bc hydro bc government campbell s government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration some of the communities in northern british columbia such as fort st john dawson creek black gold and fort mcmurray have had significant recent population booms and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska bc hydro hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market avoiding its traditional subsidy of the jobs for power program and pursuing lucrative cross border contracts with us firms at the same time hydro will be moving to slice community programs anywhere from to million and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the million range bc hydro whose annual revenues hover typically around million is looking at early mini budget estimates for to be in the million range its trading subsidiary powerex has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court bc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell from campbell s transition team we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate although we believe he is a vice president at west coast energy the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november in the meantime campbell and gary collins the finance minister will be calling the shots on hydro s future keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines neufeld has the official title but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda bonneville power administration financial solvency after having a chance to speak with a source close to sen patty murray s d wa office it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional billion in borrowing authority over the billion of existing authority it already has may be scuttled sen murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review the white house the senate appropriations committee omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill the feeling is that if the billion of additional authority would be issued the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare eight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september when there is another energy bill conference obviously now that bush s energy bill has passed the house they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for sorts mountainous sidewinders sidewinders recreancy guilted shantey

some great pictures we suggest printing it out and laying it out on your coffee table that way you have somewhere to set your red stripe so you don t leave rings on the table welcome to the expatriate zone welcome to the first issue of the expatriate zone the official newsletter of the new expatriate zone web site after publishing the temperate zone for the past two years i m taking the opportunity to join forces with bob segel who has been publishing the coconut modem with karen coyne since april of last year after operating in aol exclusively bob created parrotkey com out on the internet where it would join it s sister site on aol and be accessible to all parrot heads at the time bob expanded pk we had been working on my little area of club st somewhere and the new parrotkey com seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see club st somewhere and parrot key go we could see that this was the perfect chance to as emeril says kick it up a notch jimmy buffett s music was a big part of our lives but even more so was the expatriate lifestyle he sang about a lifestyle that includes tropical travel sailing boating parasailing and surfing and yes the music and lyrics of mr james w buffett so it is that we created our new web site the expatriate zone along with this newsletter of that same name in december the expatriate zone opened its doors with its island trading post with its holiday shopping service at the island trading post over people visited the site the first day and daily prizes were awarded for the first two weeks the island trading post will open again soon offering a complete line of tropical items not just to those of us that live a few blocks from wal mart but also for those of us lucky enough to be on a sailboat or living on an island for not we ll start with the t shirt of the month we want the expatriate zone to not only keep you entertained and informed while you toil away at your everyday corporate gig but it will also get you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into the expatriate zone we hope you all enjoy our new effort and also continue to visit parrot key and club st somewhere both of which will be closely associated with the expatriate zone and parrotkey com jackson bob expatriate of the month james sunny jim white when i first ventured on the internet in i ran in to a guy named sunny jim who was living down in the cayman islands we never really got a chance to connect for which i am truly sorry but when something is supposed to happen it usually does on the first leg of my road dawg tour click on road dawg i stayed with my good friend alex janet leist and their wonderful children over the five days i stayed at their house alex and i listened to a lot of music and one of the guys we both liked was sunny jim i bought one of james cds from alex and fell in love with it immediately the cd was his second called life in the laid back lane little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady shady floyd several times over the next six months james was embarking on his first real tour of the us since he moved down island almost twelve years ago we got several chances to talk over the summer and we will have an in depth article about this expatriate soon on the expatriate zone web site be sure to watch for it in the meantime here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great musician when i asked him about his expatriate status his reply was technically an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country for whatever reason for some it s legal reasons others just because they want to or that s where the work is i have been an expatriate for nearly twelve years now i

jeffrey vincent enron enronxgate andrew hawthorn enron enronxgate heather a johnson enron enronxgate subject possible temporary move of hpl to louisiana i finished the walk through of the th floor space located at louisiana this afternoon on the walk through with me were paul foust facilities robert humlicek jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space comments from the review are as follows most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas conference rooms etc included the floor can accommodate up to people however with this amount of people in the area space will be very tight almost all offices will need to hold at least two people large offices will need to hold three or four the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space with maximum doubling up in the offices you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers as tommy stated in his earlier e mail on the allen center space the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor the floor plan shows approximately desks on the floor some offices were locked so we could not verify the total however this number appears correct also for the most part there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied chairs filing cabinets credenzas etc would needed to be added to this space we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from there is one large area with cubicles forming a circle according to paul this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant this might work for the trading area the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity is open and would accommodate up to if we decide trader telephones are necessary record conversations etc the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule the floor has two data closets at least one of the closets has hour air conditioning according to vincent this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space a meg single mode fiber connection serves this space robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to ports however this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete probably some cabling will need to be added it appears that the space can accommodate up to users even with the extra ports needed for network printers laptops etc however if we need to accommodate more than ports bioscopic fishtailed
