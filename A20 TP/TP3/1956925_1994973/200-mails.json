"Body":"big pig :\nmet with them today and gave an overview of operations . all went well . the cfo asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction . i described the operations pricing model that i implemented several years ago . they were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow and i mentioned that through the opm we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow . the cfo asked to get some information regarding opm . i have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts . this is not currently included in the data room . do you want to review this before i pass it along to andy zipper to provide to the cfo ?\nubs :\neddie pittarelli ( head of operations for ubs ) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for newco . the spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me louise ( through amy fitzpatrick on december 19 ) totaled 172 for operations which included 32 for gas logistics . eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where ubs would again discuss their level of interest . he wanted to know if the operations staff was still primarily in tact and i confirmed that is the case . told him that the leads on gas risk gas logistics power risk settlements and documentation were all here in place . he said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in houston within the next few days . fyi \n",

"Body":"fyi .\nclaudette and tj - - please forward to your groups . thanks .\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : novosel sarah\nsent : tuesday october 16 2001 10 : 46 pm\nto : novosel sarah ; presto kevin m . ; davis mark dana ; may tom ; will lloyd ; lindberg susan ; gupta gautam ; misra narsimha ; scheuer janelle ; baughman edward d . ; herndon rogers\ncc : nicolay christi l .\nsubject : re : rto week - - summary of congestion management panel\nrto week\nday 2 - - october 16 2001\ncongestion management and transmission rights\nthe morning panel discussion was on congestion management . the panelists were : nancy brockway commissioner new hampshire psc ; reem fahey edison mission ; carol guthrie chevron texaco ; shmuel oren university of california - berkley and advises texas puc ; andy ott pjm ; michael schnitzer northbridge group .\ngeneral observations\nthe commissioners were again all present ( wood left mid - morning to give testimony on capitol hill ) . today however ferc staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions . the topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again . this will probably continue for the rest of the week . what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energy market based using lmp . very few panelists have opposed this ; at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized - - basically conceding that pjm s system will be implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else .\nlocational marginal pricing\nthe panelists all agreed that lmp in the real time market is necessary ( schmuel oren does not oppose it ) . most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across rtos . andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized . carol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect . she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works .\nftrs versus flowgates\nthe panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not physical . schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear . most of the panelists including the psc commissioner prefer ftrs rather than flowgates . schmuel is a flowgate advocate . after some discussion the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could work together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood . andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs ( liquidity standard product ) and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point - to - point rights then ftrs and flowgates can coexist . if a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay . however if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling the two cannot coexist . schmuel seemed to agree with this premise although this is not his preference . he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs . brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs .\nthe panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or flowgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not agreed upon .\nferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates . many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstances change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant . schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable .\nthe panelists agreed that these financial rights ( either ftrs or flowgates ) should be tradable in the secondary market . the panelists disagreed on which instrument - - ftrs or flowgates - - are more tradable . andy thinks ftrs are more tradable ; schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable .\noptions versus obligations\nthe panelists discussed the benefits of having ftrs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow . andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs being allocated . schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front .\nthe afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion . steve walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly .\nlet me know if you have any questions .\nsara\n",

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date january 1999 .\namong es power 3 s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay listed as a director and mcmahon and fastow listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn t immediately returned .\ndemands demands\nrating agencies moody s fitch and s & p recently put enron s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade or junk bonds suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .\nif enron s rating drops below investment grade it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade .\nfriday the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron s condition .\nthis week a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however in a friday press release ceo lay said that enron was the market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . he added : it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . \nmcmahon reportedly objected to fastow s role in ljm allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he s connected to don t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity .\nunder the radar : enron s flickering bulb\nby christopher edmonds\nspecial to thestreet . com\n10 26 2001 05 : 08 pm edt\nurl :\nwhile the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out it s clearly flickering . to date investors aren t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness .\nwhat s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ve been imagined with any number of ne er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said i never had to worry about enron s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . \npeter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron s adventures for some time . if you d listened to him earlier this year you d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding .\nthe rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are for now just that . and enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis nor is royal dutch shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess his departure appears only indirectly related to enron s current woes .\nnow enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and more importantly its reputation .\nthe company s challenge\nbut what does enron do now ? it s very simple . come clean clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks .\n our gut feel is that enron can pull it off and long - term investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months says jeff dietert power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . \ndietert outlines four challenges for enron . one management must regain the street s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .\nstraightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .\nalthough enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren t so sure . they re focused on the company s global assets portfolio sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .\nthe divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however enron has to execute here and given the current state of its affairs the seller will feel the pressure .\nthe credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings bbb + from standard & poor s and baal from moody s are three levels above non - investment grade . however both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron limiting enron s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . \nit s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it s a tough call that requires strict individual discipline .\nthere s an irony to this whole story especially in enron s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign enron looking to challenge conventional wisdom asks the simple question why ? ask why . \ninvestors are now asking . it s time for ken lay to answer .\nfirst things first\nmany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade .\nthe choice was easy . i m with him and my family .\nenjoy your weekend with family and friends .\ndj enron unit new england market downplay report of default\n2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york )\nby kristen mcnamara\nof dow jones newswires\nnew york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its\ncredit requirement in new england s wholesale power market this month but the\nevent was neither unique nor newsworthy the energy company and the\norganization that developed the market s rules said friday .\nthe operator of the region s wholesale power market informed enron energy\nservices last week that for the third time in 12 months it had traded a\ngreater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at\nrisk for expulsion from new england s market .\nbut it was administrative mixups rather than financial problems that\ntriggered the warning which a few other companies have also received in the\npast the market s rulemaker said .\n i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other\nparticipants that have defaulted on their credit agreements and it s never\nbeen in the news said david doot secretary and general counsel for the new\nengland power pool which developed the policies governing the region s\nelectricity market . my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of\nproportion . \nnews of the enron unit s default appeared in a trade publication and a major\nmetropolitan newspaper this week as enron s dealings with partnerships headed\nby its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company s\nstock and bond prices .\nenron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its\nbonding requirement twice before because both times it corrected the problem\nwithin a day spokeswoman peggy mahoney said .\nthe letter sent by iso new england which operates the region s power market \nto notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong\nperson delaying the company s response mahoney said .\n clearly it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to\nensure that we would never exceed the volume limit mahoney said .\nthe company resolved the problem by oct . 19 mahoney said . iso new england\nspokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its\ndefault .\nit s rare for a company to default three times but it has happened on\noccasion foley and doot said .\n i won t say it s commonplace but i won t say it s unusual for a participant\nto find itself out of compliance doot said . those things have in fact\nhappened from time to time . \n- by kristen mcnamara dow jones newswires ; 201 -

recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by enron s cfo and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets .\nif you are a member of an enron retirement plan wish to discuss this announcement or have information relevant to the investigation you may contact paralegal liza catabay or any member of our team ( britt tinglum liza catabay or lynn sarko ) toll free at 800 776 -

"Body":"in another surprise move the puc approved an edison bailout today on a 5 - 0 vote . this item was not on the commission s agenda other than as a placeholder regarding litigation . we do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to edison s svp of regulatory affairs and here s a summary :\nthe commission will keep current rates in place through 2003\nany overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $ 3 . 3 b in edison s past due accounts ( the so - called undercollection )\nif edison collects the $ 3 . 3 b prior to 2003 then rates can change\nif edison has not collected the $ 3 . 3 b by the end of 2003 the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder . half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005 .\nany refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $ 3 . 3 b undercollection .\nedison can keep 10 % of any refunds received after the $ 3 . 3 b is paid off .\nedison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $ 3 . 3 b .\nedison can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price risk .\nedison will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs ( i . e . if dwr s costs go up the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of edison s rates )\nthe puc will not fine edison during this period if edison s capital structure varies from the puc - approved capital structure\nedison must drop its lawsuits against the puc regarding 1 ) the filed rate doctrine and 2 ) the so - called turn accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place .\nedison agrees to cooperate with the attorney general and the puc in all litigation against suppliers .\nthe puc decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the governor recently announced\nwe will report back with additional details as soon as we get them .\nbest \njeff\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : dasovich jeff\nsent : tuesday october 02 2001 2 : 45 pm\nto : kean steven j . ; belden tim ; sharp vicki ; blachman jeremy ; comnes alan ; tribolet michael ; walsh kristin ; delainey david ; leff dan ; frazier lamar ; keeney kevin ; gahn scott ; swain steve ; lavorato john ; kaufman paul ; steffes james d . ; calger christopher f . ; mara susan ; black don ; richter jeff ; kitchen louise ; dietrich janet ; mara susan ; robertson linda ; kingerski harry ; denne karen ; palmer mark a .

"Body":"dear friend \ntop of the day to you .\nyou may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you\ndon tknow me personally ; i am kokayi gamba the first son of\nmoyo gamba who was recently murdered in a land dispute in\nzimbabwe .\ni am writing this letter to solicit your assistance and confidentiality to\nhandle a transfer of fund into a foreign account and i decided to write\nyou my late father was among the few black zimbabwean rich farmers\nmurdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president\nrobert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean\nopposition party controlled by the white minority before my fathers\ndeath he deposited the sum of twelve million united state dollars\n( $ 12 million ) with a security and finance company in johannesburg and he\nmade the deposit in my name as if he foresaw the looming danger in\nzimbabwe .\nthis money was allocated for the purchase of new machinery and\nchemical products for agro allied farm and for the establishment of new\nfarms in lesotho and swaziland . these land problems arose when president\nrobert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich\nwhite farmers and the blacks vehemently condemned the modus operandi \nadopted by the government . this resulted to rampant killings and mob\naction by the war veterans and some political thugs precisely more than\nthree thousands ( 3 000 ) people have so far been killed .\nheads of government from the west especially britain and united states\nhave voiced their condemnation of mugabe s plans . subsequently south\nafrica development community ( s . a . d . c ) has continuously supported mugabe s\nnew land act it is against this background that my entire family who are\ncurrently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my father s\nmoney into a foreign account . as the eldest son of my father i am saddled\nwith the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this\nmoney could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are\ntactically freezing our family s wealth and south africa government seem\nto be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing\nthis money in south africa for the fear of encountering the same\nexperience in the future since both countries have the same political\nhistory .\nmore so the south africa foreign exchange policy does not allow such\ninvestment hence i am seeking for political asylum in the netherlands . as\na business person whom i entrusted my future and that of my family into\nhis hands i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and\nthe nature of your business does not necessarily matter . for your\nassistance we are offering you 15 % of the sum 80 % for me and my family \nwhile 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incurred during\nthis transaction . we wish to invest our money on commercial properties\nbased on your advice .\nfinally i will demand for assurance that you will not sit on the money\nwhen it gets to the account you are going to provide in your\ncountry .\nif this proposal is accepted by you please confirm by sending me an email .\nthank you and god bless you .\nawaiting your urgent respond .\nbest regard \nkokayi gamba . .\nplaats je zoekertjes gratis op advalvas\nplacez votre petite annonce gratuitement sur advalvas\nhttp : www . advalvas . b\n",
